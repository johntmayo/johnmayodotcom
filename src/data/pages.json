Many are not and more\r\nare leaving home to go. In time, as in all wars, the soldier we supported in\r\ntime of conflict will be forgotten in time of peace. From top to bottom, they\r\nare the men and women who carry on their shoulders the pride of a nation. Our\r\nmemories of them may never die, but eventually, they will fade away.</p>\r\n<p>On the back of our memorial at the Clarksdale City Auditorium are the words,\r\n&quot;For those who fought for it, life has a flavor the protected will never\r\nknow.&quot;</p>\r\n<p><i>You know all too well the </i> first<i> story of the American Patriot, wrote General\r\nDouglas McArthur. He continues, &quot;The story is one of the American Soldier.\r\nTo be one is the birthright of every American citizen. In his love and loyalty\r\nfor God, country, and family, he gives all that human life can give. He has\r\nwritten our history in foreign lands.&quot; </i>From Corrigedor to Khe Sahn; from\r\nBellieu Woods to Panama; from Inchon to Baghdad, he has guaranteed our\r\nfreedom at home. <i> (Italics McArthur's words)</i></p>\r\n<p><i>&quot;From one end of the world to the other, the American Soldier has\r\ndrained deep the cup of courage. In staggering columns on a long, weary march,\r\nthrough bellowing clouds turned up by miles of mechanized cavalry, from dusk to\r\ndawn, covered with mud, chilled by rain, the American Soldier advances to his\r\nobjective, and for many, to the judgment seat of God. We do not know the dignity\r\nof his birth,&quot; says McArthur, &quot;but we know the glory of his\r\ndeath.&quot;</i></p>\r\n<p><i>With their blood they have stained the soils</i> of Tarawa, Kasserine\r\nPass, Hamburger Hill, Pusan, and Fallujah. With their sweat they built bridges\r\nbetween cultures; with their tears, they held the children and buried the dead\r\nstarved by fanatic dictators.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>They went to war to fight for their country, secure freedom, or because their\r\nfathers did before them. But, they fought the battles for the guy on their left\r\nand on their right.</p>\r\n<p>This is the American Soldier who carries on his shoulders the pride of our\r\ncountry.</p>\r\n<p>And this is the second story of an American Patriot. She is the veteran who\r\ndrops a tear each time the flag is raised; who struggles to right himself when\r\nthe National Anthem is played; who heard the call of his country before his\r\ncountry ever called.</p>\r\n<p>She is the Mother who mourns her son. Between his high school diploma and\r\nPurple Heart there is the picture of him she dusts every day.</p>\r\n<p>The American Patriot is the wife who takes her children to school each\r\nmorning, goes to work, pays the bills, and goes to sleep at night, wondering\r\nwhen she will lay next to her soldier/husband again and what he will be like\r\nwhen he returns.</p>\r\n<p>He is the father who proudly tells anyone who will listen &quot;My daughter\r\ngraduated high school last year. Last week she drove a Humvee into Baghdad.</p>\r\n<p>And the American Patriots are the sons and daughters of soldiers, sailors,\r\nmarines, and airmen who know only that Mommy or Daddy are in some distant\r\ncountry protecting the lives of children just like them.</p>\r\n<p>They sacrifice for us. Because they are American patriots who heeded the\r\nwords of President John Kennedy &quot;to bear any burden, pay any price, support\r\nany friend, oppose any foe to insure the place of liberty&quot;.</p>\r\n<p>These are American Patriots. They bear the burden of wars long after the\r\npeace is signed and the troops are home. For them, life does indeed have a\r\nflavor the protected will never know.</p>\r\n<p>Running through their lives is a thread that connects God, Country, Family.\r\nThey know that without God, there is no country, and without country there is no\r\nplace to raise a family in peace. To be an American Patriot, therefore, one must\r\nbe willing to sacrifice to preserve our way of life to worship God, honor\r\ncountry, and raise a family. The American Patriot chooses to give up the\r\ntrappings of the good life to secure for us the values of what makes life good.</p>\r\n<p>So I ask you to remember that young man in Iraq, the daughter in Kosovo, the\r\nfather in the Philippines, the son in Afghanistan, and the Mother, the wife,\r\nfather, son and daughter at home. I ask you to never forget�the veteran of the\r\nArdennes Forest, the Sailor at Pearl Harbor, the private at the Chosin\r\nReservoir, the grunt at Khe Sahn, the nurse in Desert Storm, and the airman\r\nflying patrol over our cities. For all of them duty, honor, and country are the\r\nflavors of life. They saw their duty to serve with honor the country they love.\r\nFor many of us, we will never know their sacrifice; we will never truly taste\r\nthe flavors of life they have won for us.</p>\r\n<p>We are the protected and we owe them our gratitude. There will always be a\r\nland of freedom because there are free men, women, and children who courageously\r\nvolunteer to wear the mantle of an American patriot.</p>\r\n<p>General Douglas McArthur in his closing remarks to Congress lamented that <i> Old\r\nSoldiers never die, they simply fade away.</i> Don�t let our soldiers in Kuwait\r\nand Iraq or anywhere an American soldier is asked to go fade away. Remember them\r\nthrough your letters, and your prayers for their families. We know them well.\r\nThey are our neighbors, coworkers, and friends. They are American Patriots\r\npreserving our birthright to worship God, honor country, and raise our families\r\nin peace. Before he left for Iraq, a young soldier implored, &quot;Please, don�t\r\nlet them forget about us.&quot; Remember them. For you and me and our families,\r\nthey have volunteered to take the field of battle. Be grateful they live among\r\nus.</p>\r\n<p>Thank you and God Bless the United States of America</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/_vti_bin/fpcount.exe/\" alt=\"Hit Counter\">\r\n</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</font>&nbsp;",

It was after midnight, a Vietnamese band was playing US songs.&nbsp; I\r\nremembered, I have been here before.</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">Next Email</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">Goooooooood Morning,\r\nMississippi</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">It's 5:30 a.m. Friday\r\nmorning here---from Vietnam&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">Goooooooooood, Morning\r\nMississippi!</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">Wow, it's great to be\r\nalive!&nbsp; We are going into the Mekong Delta and where I spent 12 of my 18\r\nmonths in Vietnam.&nbsp; If it is like yesterday, there will be a lot of\r\nchanges.&nbsp; I just could not believe the sprawl.&nbsp; Stopped at a roadside\r\nfruit stand to get mangroves and other native fruits...I passed.</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">Our guide has been\r\nGREAT.&nbsp; Young man, 31...went to University here to major in tourism.&nbsp;\r\nTheir school year and grades are identical to ours.&nbsp; BUT--and something I\r\nagree with--once you graduate from&nbsp;high school&nbsp;you have a choice to\r\nmake---university or two years in the military. Either get an education or serve\r\nyour country before going to work.</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">Your opportunites here are\r\nnot dictated by the state.&nbsp; You can do what you want.&nbsp; Except for\r\nthose industries of national impact--oil, transportation, the like---private\r\nbusiness is private.&nbsp; Headlines in yesterday's paper was signing of\r\nagreements between U.S. companies and Vietnam for business ventures.&nbsp; The\r\nbusinesses will be owned by the businesses.&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">With 8.5 million people in\r\nthis city alone and more than a million around, there are opportunities.&nbsp;\r\nKFC is the only fast food franchise spread out over the city.&nbsp; I saw ad for\r\none Pizza Hut in a high end office building.&nbsp; Some of the newer buildings\r\nare very modern, glass structures.&nbsp; If I remember will include a picture of\r\none just for Agnes (The Diamond Plaza).</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">As to the food.&nbsp;\r\nExcept for evening meal in hotel (and except for one night, I have chosen\r\nVietnamese--first night I just had to have SPAGHETTI!) have eaten on the local\r\n&quot;economy&quot;. Food tastes great, have lost perhaps a couple pounds due to\r\nlow fat food.&nbsp; I've eaten a lot of it!</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">Will include picture of\r\nsecond course soup serving of shrimp, noodles, broth, fresh vegetables.&nbsp;\r\nThe soup is in cocoanut shell.</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">Some observations:&nbsp;\r\nAT our consulate yesterday morning was HUGE, I mean HUGE crowd of people waiting\r\nto obtain a VISA.&nbsp; Guide says that everyone wants to come to U.S. to see\r\nfamily or attend college.&nbsp; The world hates us---but it is where the world\r\nwants to go.</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">Went by the water\r\ntreatment plant--Trudy Fisher of DEQ and Dr. Thompson at Dept of Health--when I\r\nwas here, it was a lone structure on a hill protected by tanks (armored, not\r\nwater) with plenty of expanse around it.&nbsp; Today it is sprawled and there is\r\nno open ground to be seen anywhere.</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">Ads:&nbsp; from huge\r\nbillboards to small store signs there is a mixture of Vietnamese and English\r\nsignage.&nbsp; What's noticeable is the omnipresence and use of the western,\r\nidealized (by men&nbsp; of course) women to grab attention for everything from\r\ncomputers to hair design.&nbsp; The Vietnamese women pictures in some ads all\r\nare made up to look lke western women--short skirts, cleavage (I notice\r\neverything) facial make up.</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">Businessmen here where\r\nsuits, women where appropriate dress or business outfits.&nbsp; Have seen (and\r\nvery, very few) eamples of &quot;plumbers cracks&quot; either in the your men or\r\nwomen.&nbsp; Many, Many people are dressed &quot;like us&quot; on\r\nstreets---comfortable jeans or slacks, pullovers.&nbsp; I think I was the only\r\nperson (male) I saw wearing shorts yesterday.</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">Here's some\r\npictures:&nbsp; 2 is a tv on plane...watched 3 movies.&nbsp; This is one mapping\r\nthe progress of plane from Atlanta, to Canada, Alaska, and then dipping down to\r\nKorea.&nbsp; 6 is airport in Korea (Inchon/Seoul), 14 is view from the rooftop\r\nGarden of hotel;</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">23 is the Continental\r\nHotel---car bombed during the war, 31 is the inside of the post office.&nbsp; I\r\ndo not have an email quality outside picture to send, but it was built by French\r\nway early last century and around the building are plaques naming outstanding\r\nFrench scientists, except for one of them...any guess as to who?&nbsp; If you\r\nsaid ol' Ben Franklin, you would be right...The French all but worshipped him\r\nand he the French women.&nbsp; picture 36 is Notre Dame Cathedral across street\r\nfrom Post office.&nbsp; Daily Mass is still offered here.</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">51 is inside one of the\r\nmarkets we went to.&nbsp; I wish I could describe the size of the place,\r\ncompactness of the stalls, and especially the smell.&nbsp; EVERYTHING is sold in\r\nhere including (literally) the Kitchen sink.&nbsp; Kitchen pots and pans, cloth\r\n(more raw cloth than you'll ever see in your life in one place), clothes, fish\r\n(live), fresh vegetables, fruits, cooked food.&nbsp; Wal Mart must have gotten\r\nits inspiration from here.&nbsp; 52 is the outside of the market (this building\r\nis nearly 100 years old), 63 is an example of the wiring grid both telephone and\r\nelectrical prevcalent in Saigon except in the hotel area.</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">109 is the presentation\r\nfor the soup course and tea totalers---YOU WILL learn to develop a taste for\r\nbeer or risk Montezuma's revenge, 111 is the presentation cocoanut shell open to\r\ndip out the soup, and the last one, 116, is a barge in the background and an old\r\nman plying the Saigon river in his boat.</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">Well, that's it for this\r\nmorning.&nbsp; In a couple of hours am going to the Delta.&nbsp; Am really\r\nlooking forward to this part of the trip.</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">John</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">More, later.</font></p>\r\n<font FACE=\"Tahoma\" SIZE=\"2\">\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n</font>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">Next one:</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">End Of Day</font></p>\r\n<font SIZE=\"3\">\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">Traffic is organized\r\nchaos.&nbsp; Trust me on this...you might think you can drive in any condition,\r\nbut, trust me, I know of no one who could make it on the streets over\r\nhere.&nbsp; Watching from the roof top restaurant last night, the scene below\r\nlooked like orchestrated ballet, without the conductor.</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">No traffic police, no\r\ntraffic lights, but at a major intersection, thousands of motorcycles made it\r\nthrough.&nbsp; In one 30 second period, counted 57 motorbikes, one car.&nbsp;\r\nNow, that was just in one lane going one way on a four lane boulevard.&nbsp;\r\nThat does not count oncoming, crossing, or traffic going in the wrong direction\r\nand at 9:30 at night.&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">The main boulevards are\r\nbeautiful with parks separating the opposing lanes, with trees, gardens, and\r\nsculptures in the central business district.&nbsp;This morning at 6, people were\r\nplaying bamitton for exercise in the traffic! Side streets and areas out side of\r\nCBD is quite the opposite, narrow, congested, everyman and woman for themselves,\r\ndriver (any driver) seems to have the right away.</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">On the streets and in the\r\nhotels, everyone says good morning, smiles, very friendly.</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">Went to a pagoda on our\r\ntrip yesterday.&nbsp; Part of it was roof covered, part exposed to the sky and\r\nthere was an afternoon shower.&nbsp; Incense burning.&nbsp; There was a sense of\r\ndeep reverance and you could really feel it.&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">Also went to a\r\n&quot;factory&quot; where handicapped persons, mostly veterans (have I said this\r\nbefore...losing track of time) design and make the Mother-of-pearl inlaid\r\npictures, jewelry boxes, jewelry that you see.&nbsp; Unbelievable\r\ncraftsmanship.&nbsp; It is all really done by hand, from washing the pearl\r\nshells, duck egg shells, to chipping, peeling, affixing painting.&nbsp; I've\r\nalways thought &quot;handmade&quot; meant someone turned the machine on.&nbsp;\r\nReal people really do make those items.</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">From the government\r\nbuildings yesterday, the country's flag waved.&nbsp; A single gold star against\r\na red background.&nbsp; The flag the North Vietnamese had.&nbsp; Really didn't\r\nmatter to or bother me.&nbsp; At supper last night atop the hotel on Rooftop\r\nGarden Restaurant, you could make out the Continental Hotel a couple blocks\r\naway.&nbsp; You can imagine during the war American officers, senior enlisted,\r\nand diplomats housed at the Rex where&nbsp;I am staying having breakfast four\r\ndecades ago and hearing, seeing the Continental car bombed early on in the war\r\nand how they must have felt.</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">Across the street, the\r\nVietnamese flag was lighted and waving.&nbsp; It mattered.</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">Despite your feelings on\r\nthat, you have to hand it to the Vietnamese people.&nbsp; Through 1,000-1,500 or\r\nmore years of history they have been occupied by one foreign country or another\r\nfor the better part of their existence; yet, as a people they have\r\npersevered.&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">They are extremely hard\r\nworkers.&nbsp; Did see a number of street people, but in a city of 8.5 million\r\nyou would be surprised not to.</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">John</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">Next One</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">Can Tho</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">We are in the heart of the\r\nMekong Delta...Can Tho...The largest city (one million) in the Delta and the\r\nlast big city before reaching Cambodia about 2 hours or less away. Can Tho is\r\n150 miles from Saigon but it took us nearly five to get here. traffic was\r\nhorrendous. I cannot even begin to describe bumper to bumper, no man's land\r\npassing, 1o's of thousands of mopeds...Have you ever scene a family of husband,\r\nwife, and two children on one of these things. How about one carrying a washing\r\nmachine, and another with five dogs. Get this...three on a threesided basket in\r\nback, one across the gas tank, and the other in the driver's lap...he was taking\r\nthem the obedience school!</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">And the shops...150 miles\r\ngain of one after another in very few spaces only an honest to God's factory\r\nfilled the gap. There is no zoning, little interference from the government.\r\nIncidentally we were told sales tax is 10% and income tax is a flat 10% no\r\ndeductions.</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">You pay to go to public\r\nschool (about $200 a year) except for pre k which is 40 a month because the kids\r\nget two meals. Also if you are too poor to pay, here's how they handle it. The\r\nvillage or district government of a city know who is really poor and they will\r\nwrite a letter to the school asking the child be allowed in.</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">Also, if you are old and\r\npoor, your children must take care of you. If they cannot, you go to live at a\r\nhostel. If you are the poor parents of children, they go to an orphanage. Health\r\ncare is not free and according to our guide their is no free food nor transfer\r\npayments to the poor.</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">We could not find or the\r\nguide did not want to go to the base camp we wanted to go to. I have to tell\r\nyou---Mac Huddleston and Mac Gordon will know this, this aina't your Daddy's\r\narmy days Mekong Delta. The pot holed two lane highway is four lane. There are\r\nno open areas with rice paddies, swamps, or palm tree jungles. It is wall to\r\nwall shsops the whole way. Despite the crowded conditions, I did recognize the\r\nturn off for the basecamp, only because the once two lane original bridge going\r\ninto Tan An is still there along with another two laner in opposite direction.\r\nWe made it clear in no uncertain terms to the guide, we would take a left hand\r\nturn outside Tan An on the way back.</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">Mac, if Dong Tam is still\r\nthere, I and you would not know it. Our guide did take us to a site where the VC\r\noverwhelmed an ARVN (Army of Republic of Vietnam--The &quot;good guys&quot;) in\r\n1963. Some 200 ARVH soldiers were killed with their three US advisors. The\r\nhelicopter shot down is displayed (or one like it) and around what is left of\r\nthe defensive areas are displays of where a chopper went down, APC burned, or\r\nbomb dropped. If I am not mistaken while it was a wiwn for the VC, it was the\r\nbattle that eventually brought in regular US troops. I believe, this was the one\r\nwhere the advisors had to plead with the area commander to commit more ARVN\r\ntroops and he would not. The request went up to HQ iin Saigon and they refused\r\nreinforcements.</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">Eventually the decision\r\nwas made by US commanders that if we were to be iin this war, US troops would\r\nhave to fight it. I hope we have learned a lesson from that battle that if a\r\ncountry requesting our aid refuses to mobilize, train, pay, and commit their\r\nforces first, we are better off to back off from the invite.</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">I have often railed aboput\r\nthe (I know I will mispell) beugiosse--I won't even attempt living the high life\r\namong the little people, but iin Can Tho, we are staying at a nice, a very nice\r\nhotel. Can Tho is a much cleaner city it appears than Saigon, of course it onl;y\r\nhas a million people to &quot;control&quot;.</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">Here's some more pictures.\r\nAs I attach them, I'll explain 125 are some homes amongst the squalor for the\r\nricher.</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">128 are women and older\r\nmen working in a rice paddy. Like the US, somethings are the same. Our guide\r\ntold us that younger people do not like the hardwork. This work use to be women\r\nonly, now older men must do, too. They are planting rice plants by hand. 132 is\r\na family plot in the middle of the rice field. You these then and now dotted all\r\nover the country side in the middle of fields. My unit was attacked by RPG's\r\nfrom behind a group of crypts. I called for artillery which would not fire and\r\ndustoff helicopters would not come in to take out our wounded until we\r\nsuppressed the firing. I did thenn, and feel sorry to some extant now for the\r\nfamilies of the dead in those crypts. I had 106 mm jeep mounted recoiless rifles\r\nwhich were very accurate.</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">By the way, in Vietnam,\r\ncouples are allowed by government to have two children. !8 is the age for women,\r\n21 for men to marry. In the city, both men and women wait until they have\r\nestabl;ished themselves with a good job and decent apartment before marrying and\r\nput off starting a family. In the country, they do manage to marry earlier, do\r\nnot put off having children, and by 25 they have three.</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">We did get of the main\r\nroad to go to the war memorial and picture 135 is a country road and is what the\r\nmain road looked like 40 years ago. This one would have been dirt. 145 is rice\r\nbeing put on the road to dry. Prior to this they would have through stalk, chaff\r\nand all into the air. The rice being heavier would fall, the rest blow away. 149\r\nis an interesting one. We decided these &quot;MIGHT&quot; be punji stakes. The\r\nends are sharpened, they are pointed in the same angle, they are barely out of\r\nthe water, and they are hardwood. They are in the area of the battle I described\r\nearlier and would have blocked soldiers coming across the creek to aid the\r\nattacking or besieged troops.</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">185 is a shop that looks\r\njust like the thousands of other shops lining the road, 164 is a ladt making\r\nincence that you might be burning next week, 188 are more shops, and 213 are\r\nactually nicer shops by the restaurant we ate at.</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">Again, there's much more,\r\nbut if you got this far, I hope you don't mind me sending pictures. The internet\r\nhas made this so easy. I am at the hotel, but even iin the backwater towns here,\r\nthey have access to wireless internet &quot;cafes&quot; everywhere.</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">John</font></p>\r\n<font FACE=\"Consolas\" SIZE=\"3\">\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n</font>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">Next One:</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">By the Way</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">Our guide's wife is a\r\nteacher of pre-k through 3rd grade.</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">She makes $100 a month,\r\nuniversity educated. He will make more than that in tips for this trip of\r\nsix-seven days work.</font></p>\r\n<font FACE=\"Consolas\" SIZE=\"3\">\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n</font>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">Next One</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">Discovered basecamp</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">Sunday Night 9:33\r\np.m.---9:33 a.m. Mississippi time</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">I cannot begin to describe\r\nto you the morning. We were coming back from Can Tho, our guide said he and the\r\ndriver now knew the way to Tan Tru. 3 hours later we were asking for directions.\r\nLook, I knew how to get there. We went over and stopped at two places with\r\nbridges. I had indeed built a bridge at both places which were eventually\r\nreplaced by concrete bridges. Then an old man said he knew of a bridge that\r\nAmericans built that was still there.</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">Now as you view these\r\npictures, any hardtop roads you see were dirt when I was there...we called the\r\nmaterial laterite or as some of us Southerners noted, &quot;The red clay of\r\ngeorgia&quot;. On this or the next group of pictures you will see just how\r\nwide/narrow the road was in the dirt road scene. Those roads have not changed.</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">In this group of pictures,\r\nyou will see me with a group to townspeople. THEY WERE CHILDREN WHEN I BUILT THE\r\nBRIDGE! I had my original pictures and they began yelling for friends and\r\npointing themselves out in the pictures. They all remembered us doing the\r\nbridge. When I get hole and post the pictures on my website, you will see\r\n&quot;then&quot; and &quot;Now&quot; The 287 foot bridge is now concrete, mine\r\nwas timber.</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">You will also see a river.\r\nThis is a major tributary of the Mekong. From here we launched our large rafts\r\nto carry APC's or the small ones to carry infantry. You will see a picture with\r\na van on the road. This was a large dirt, just plain dirt path. We landed our\r\nhelicopters here to load up and start an assault on a position.</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">You will also see a modern\r\ntwo story school following those river pictures. This is a community college. It\r\nis built on our basecamp and the first one is exactly where my platoon's\r\npositions were. We eventually took matters into our own hands because every time\r\na Chinook landed, it would lift our ten man (GP MEDIUM TENTS) out of their\r\nstakes. We travelled to where Mac Huddleston was stationed and stole corrugated\r\ntin roofing from the supply point for our roof and got rid of the tents.</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">Unfortunately we were\r\nordered by the battalion commander who saw the contraband to steal some more and\r\npass it out---we did---we were good at what we did.</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">You will see a tall\r\nmemorial. This is dedicated to the VC who died in the area.

Sunday---it is\r\nnow Monday morning 6:30 a.m. as I write this.</font></font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">&nbsp;After a discussion\r\nwith our guide&nbsp;while we were mired &quot;in the boonies&quot; with him\r\ntrying to find a place on my &quot;operations map&quot;, I convinced him to take\r\na right, go 1.5 kilometers and if there were not a sharp right turn in the road\r\nin the middle of a hamlet followed immediately by a sharp left and BANG, your at\r\na river, we could turn around and go back to Saigon.</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">&nbsp;As we entered the\r\nhamlet, now a town with all the thatched hooches&nbsp; gone, there it was, the\r\nturn, the &quot;S&quot; turn, the river.&nbsp; A timber bridge I built 41 years\r\nago with 11 men is gone, replaced by a concrete structure.&nbsp; Gone are all\r\nthe hooches that were there, the huge thatched rice storage house, all replaced\r\nby tin buildings.</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">&nbsp;But there was a\r\nstucco home on the upside of the bridge where my medic played guitar to\r\nentertain the children.&nbsp; There was the river flowing as fast as ever, and\r\nthere were people, people who were children when my men built this bridge.</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">&nbsp;When I pulled out my\r\n41 year old Kodak moments, they began calling for people and soon we had a crowd\r\nof laughing women and puzzled men.&nbsp; They recognized themselves in my\r\npictures.&nbsp; They are now 50-55 years old.&nbsp; People were hugging me,\r\nlaughing, passing my half dozen or so pictures around.&nbsp; Showing me who they\r\nwere in the pictures, they held their hands over their mouths and gasped and\r\nthen let out with a laugh.&nbsp; They remembered, as I had, when we built that\r\nbridge 40 years ago last summer</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">&nbsp;I had one of myself\r\nand four of the guys in the platoon chilling out back at our basecamp in another\r\nhamlet with some Carling Black Label.&nbsp; They pointed me out skinny body and\r\nall.</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">&nbsp;&nbsp;When I began\r\ntaking pictures of the underside of the bridge, a group of children jumped into\r\nthe picture, and then more.&nbsp; I might return in 40 years to show them what\r\nthey looked like, and then again, I might just be a feeble old man of 101\r\ntelling anyone who will listen about a bridge I built in Vietnam to link two\r\nparts of a hamlet.</font></p>\r\n<font SIZE=\"3\">\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">&nbsp;Thank you, God.</font></p>\r\n</font>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">Next One:</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">Trip to 9<sup>th</sup>\r\nInfantry Division Base Camp</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font COLOR=\"#999999\" face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">Posted\r\n6/26/2008 8:32 PM CDT on clarionledger.com</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">Don't worry (as if you\r\nmight).&nbsp; I am ok.&nbsp; Today as we I went to our old army base and found\r\nwhat was left of the berm, and went through the traffic, I came to a near death\r\nexperience.&nbsp; It was awful, frightening, I was scared out of wits when it\r\noccured.&nbsp; I could not believe I attempted it.&nbsp; I thought sure half way\r\nthrough the experience Steve Holland and Earle Banks would be on the next flight\r\nto Saigon.&nbsp; Thank you, Jesus, for my quick recovery.</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">&nbsp;I crossed a street\r\nin Saigon at 8:45 p.m. tonight trying to obtain my First Coca Cola and Chips.</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">&nbsp;Remember what I said\r\nabout I didn't think anyone back home could drive over here?&nbsp; Well, let me\r\nadd, only the brave, dumbfounded, or starving would dare attempt crossing eight\r\nlanes.&nbsp; No wonder these are boulevards.&nbsp; There two lanes going one\r\nway, a grassy median, four lanes of two each in opposite directions, a grassy\r\nmedian, then two more lanes in an opposite direction of the first two.&nbsp; The\r\nmedians are a necessity for heart checks and rest!</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">&nbsp;We left Saigon today\r\ngoing north and east.&nbsp; Now, as I remember it, once out of Saigon, it was\r\nall rice paddies, open fields, rubber plantations to our base camp, but nooooo.&nbsp;\r\nIt's all built up with shops for 20 miles.&nbsp;&nbsp;The shops are no more than\r\n20 feet wide, if that and on each side share a common wall.&nbsp; Will post\r\npictures on my website when I return.&nbsp; Imagine this scene from Jackson to\r\nMadison up HWY 51.</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">&nbsp;I did find the 9th\r\nDiv Basecamp.&nbsp; Could not tell what, if anything, is left as it is now a\r\nVietnamese army camp.&nbsp; There was a berm that was probably what is left of\r\nour original perimeter berm.&nbsp; Trees are growing on it and what was once\r\n400-1000 meters of free fire zone we cleared is now a mangrove plantation.</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">&nbsp;Also large amounts\r\nof tapioca farming going on.</font></p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">&nbsp;I am going to attach\r\nsome pictures here and will try to give an explanation.&nbsp;

If you are sensitive to two words\r\nthat are not PC.&nbsp; Do not read this, but �Gosh, Golly� just do not\r\ndescribe the moment.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent:.5in\">For some reason on July 4 as I\r\nwrite this, I feel a whole lot better than I did two weeks ago and two weeks ago\r\nI did not feel bad.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent:.5in\">Governments in their efforts to\r\nwin wars may fail.&nbsp; Diplomats in their efforts to negotiate a settlement to\r\nsave face, may or may not have success.&nbsp; But, the American soldier, the\r\ninstrument for government policy, will get it right.&nbsp; When left to his or\r\nher own desire to be human in war, the American soldier will prevail and find a\r\nway to make peace one person at a time.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent:.5in\">I came away from my one week trip\r\nto Vietnam convinced that the American soldier has won the war.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAllow me to start at the ending before going to the beginning.&nbsp; On June 28,\r\n2008 after a 41 year absence, I rediscovered the affect of the American soldier\r\non a hamlet.&nbsp; We were returning from a visit to Can Tho, Vietnam and headed\r\nto Ho\r\nChi Minh City.&nbsp; We were looking for Tan Tru and the base camp of the 1<sup>st</sup>\r\nPlatoon, Company C, 15th Combat Engineers, 9<sup>th</sup> Infantry Division\r\nsupporting the combat operations of the 2<sup>nd</sup>/60<sup>th</sup> Infantry,\r\n9<sup>th</sup> Infantry Division.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe guide stopped several times to ask directions to bridges Americans built 40\r\nyears ago ( I knew&nbsp; the way from memory, but I don�t think our guide\r\nwanted to take a chance on the memory of a 61 year old).&nbsp; We found a bridge still\r\nstanding and while I was elated, proud, ecstatic that it was one built by my\r\nplatoon, this was not the one I had set out to find.&nbsp; Way out in the boonies,\r\nwe turned around to head back 50 kilometers to Ho Chi Minh City when I asked the\r\nguide to take a right, go 1.5 kilometers, turn right and take an immediate left,\r\nand then come to a halt as there would be a river, a tributary of the Mekong\r\nRiver.&nbsp; If it were not there, I said, we would go back to the city and I\r\nwould be satisfied that we tried.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAs we neared the mark, the guide turned around and said, �John, we are near\r\n1.5 Kilometers.�&nbsp; To which I said, �Turn around and look out the\r\nwindow.�&nbsp; There in front of us was a right hand turn, we took the turn,\r\nand immediately turned a sharp left�and there in front of us was the ever\r\nlovin�, friggin� bridge that forever changed my life.&nbsp; This bridge was\r\nnot mine, but one that replaced a 287 foot bridge built by 11 men and myself in\r\nseven days, defended from attack for three nights, in the middle of what use to\r\nbe a thatched hut hamlet.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe �hooches� have been replaced by brick stucco and metal and wood buildings, but, this was MY\r\nbridge and the turning point in my life in 1966-1968, my 18 months in Vietnam.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAfter taking pictures, I noticed I was being watched by a number of people.&nbsp;\r\nI got my �Kodak moment� photos I had taken 41 years ago out of the van and\r\nbegan showing them to folks.&nbsp; These pictures were of children who were ever\r\npresent&nbsp; as we constructed the timber trestle bridge.&nbsp; Children were\r\neverywhere at that time.&nbsp; And, as the folks were looking at the pictures,\r\nmany let out with a gasp, began laughing hard, calling their friends, passing\r\nthe pictures around as fast as people came to see what the commotion was all\r\nabout.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThese men and women of 45-55 were looking at themselves&nbsp; in 1967.&nbsp;\r\nThey pointed to a picture of me 40 years younger I had shown them, and I\r\nacknowledged that it was me.&nbsp; They covered their mouths, smiled, and hugged\r\nme.&nbsp; I was mobbed.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe governments of South Vietnam and the USA may have screwed it up, but the\r\nAmerican soldier got it right.&nbsp; Forty years later, I now realize, the\r\nAmerican soldier&nbsp; finally won the hearts and minds of the people.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nI was a 19 year old lieutenant platoon leader of a Combat Engineer platoon when\r\nI left Fort Riley Kansas for Vietnam in 1966.&nbsp; What would be a 12 month\r\ntour turned into 18 months that changed the course of my life.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nFrom Ho Chi Minh City to Can Tho 150 miles, but a five hour drive away and two\r\nhours from Cambodia, people everywhere went out of their way to say �hello�\r\nto three visiting Americans.&nbsp; Children from kindergarten to third grade\r\nstopped us. �Hello, where are you from?� they asked.&nbsp; When we said from\r\nthe United States, �Oh, what state?� they would inquire.&nbsp; And, these\r\nkids would strike up a short conversation in near perfect English.&nbsp; They\r\nsmiled, their parents smiled and looked prouder than any parents I have ever\r\nseen of their children.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThey are required to begin taking English in Pre-K and through most of their\r\nschool years, which are almost identical to ours.&nbsp; Here in the states, our\r\nkids take Spanish for a couple terms in High School, a language that isn�t\r\neven in the dialect of Hispanics entering our country.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nI asked our guide why the children were going out of their way to talk with us.&nbsp;\r\nHe replied, �They want to practice their English.�&nbsp; He went onto say\r\nthat many Vietnamese see the United States as a great country and they want to\r\ncome here.&nbsp; He also hoped his 14 month old son would one day visit �the\r\nUnited States of America�.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nI would like to wax philosophical of the loss of humanity in war and the\r\nconflict we soldiers face in killing the enemy who �is below human� but\r\nforging relationships with children and older people we meet to restore our own\r\nindividual humanity and find hope amidst the insaneness of war.&nbsp; But, this\r\ntrip exceeded my expectations of what we accomplished in Vietnam and I have no\r\nplace in my heart right now to talk of war.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nWhen the American soldier took a �pause for the cause� to reach out and\r\ntouch an individual Vietnamese,&nbsp; by God and all things righteous, 40 years\r\nlater we �won� the cause.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nI am not one to wear flag lapel pins.&nbsp; I paid my dues and if my actions\r\ndon�t show my patriotism, no pin will add to it.&nbsp; I was never more proud\r\nto be a citizen of the United States as I was the morning of the last day in\r\nVietnam.&nbsp; Tuesday, July 2 is a day I will never forget.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe day before, we were given a tour of the U.S. consulate.&nbsp; With reverence\r\nwe stood on the very grounds where our Embassy had been.&nbsp; We were at the\r\nspot in the Wall breached by the VC in January 1968.&nbsp; This breach was a\r\nmicrocosm of what would come.&nbsp; We wiped out the VC infrastructure\r\nthroughout the country that week.&nbsp; But, that �Victory� for us brought\r\nin the NVA and American public opinion.&nbsp; Our victory that week was the\r\nbeginning of the end.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe Vietnamese government has a 10 foot monolith on the street at the breach.&nbsp;\r\nInside, we have a simple plaque to the four soldiers and single Marine who died\r\nJanuary 31, 1968 defending the embassy.&nbsp; The reverence at that site was\r\nawesome.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAs we prepared to leave the next day (July 2), I hiked the city from our hotel\r\nback to the Consulate.&nbsp; A very wide four lane boulevard divides the\r\nConsulate grounds from hundreds of people waiting across the street to queue up\r\nto apply for a VISA to visit the USA.&nbsp; I began taking pictures of the Stars\r\nand Stripes unfurled and waving from the original flagpole of the Embassy.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nI became absolutely chilled by the goose bumps all over my body and they never\r\ndisappeared.&nbsp; I have them now as I write this.&nbsp; Here I was 40 years\r\nafter leaving Vietnam, once again on foreign soil, standing before OUR flag\r\nwaving proudly as hundreds of people waited to get in.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nKeep your flag pins. I will forever remember that engulfing moment of being damn\r\nproud to be a citizen of the United States of America.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nI was finally waved off by a Vietnamese soldier guarding the Consulate.&nbsp;\r\nBut, he was too late.&nbsp; I had my pictures and I had captured the moment.&nbsp;\r\nRemember what I said in my article before I left?&nbsp; From the movie,\r\n�Beyond the Sea�, �Memories are like moonbeams.&nbsp; Once you have one,\r\nyou can do whatever you want with it.�&nbsp; If you see me smile when the flag\r\nis raised, you will know, that along with 2.5 million American&nbsp; Soldiers,\r\nsailors, Marines, Airman, Nurses, we have been there, we have done that, and I\r\ncan assure you after 40 years, we got it right.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe person who provided for the trip and whom I accompanied summed it up far\r\nbetter than I: �We will win Vietnam in this generation because of the way the\r\npeople were treated by the American Soldier 40 years ago.&nbsp; Those kids (now\r\nthe adults we met) have not forgotten and they will want their children to live\r\nbetter.�</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThere�s so much more I would like to write, about the people and how they live\r\nand especially WORK (everyone works), the growth of the country, the changes,\r\nbut my Flag in Vietnam and the looks on the faces of the Vietnamese men and\r\nwomen all over the country and especially at THE bridge confirm my belief that\r\nwhile governments quibble, the American Soldier is the human equation in the\r\ninhumanity of war&nbsp; This is the Greatest Country in the World.&nbsp; If you\r\ncan�t believe that, why were there hundreds at the American consulate while in\r\nfront of the French consulate, there was no one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nFinally, the beginning --the trip came from a person who has seen the movie\r\n�Pay it Forward� one too many times, perhaps.&nbsp; And fellas�Tiger beer\r\nand, bah,bah, bah (333) beer are still there and as good as ever at the end of a\r\nhot day.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><o:p>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nYou will not hear this from me too often, but on this occasion��Thank you,\r\nGod, for allowing me to be a citizen of this great country�The United States\r\nof America. Thank you for allowing me to be a soldier in the Army of the United\r\nStates.&quot;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><o:p>\r\n &nbsp;</o:p>\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\">John</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\"><a href=\"mailto:jmayo@mail.house.state.ms.us\">jmayo@mail.house.state.ms.us</a></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\"><a href=\"mailto:john@johnmayo.com\">john@johnmayo.com</a></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\"><img src=\"/_vti_bin/fpcount.exe/\" alt=\"Hit Counter\">\r\n</p>\r\n&nbsp;",

Running through China, Myanmar (Burma), Laos, Thailand, and\r\nCambodia, the Mekong spreads out like fingers in Vietnam.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The network provides water for a variety of crops, the largest of which is\r\nrice.&nbsp; But grown here are tomatoes, mangroves, lettuce, cocoanuts, fruits\r\nof every exotic description, cattle, and on, and on, and on.</p>\r\n<p>Forty or more years ago when I left Saigon, I would have immediately been in\r\nthe &quot;boonies&quot;.&nbsp; A two lane road took you past rice paddies that\r\nwent on forever, elephant ear jungles where at any marker someone could ambush\r\nyou in a heartbeat.&nbsp; Unpopulated except for the towns or hamlets along the\r\nway, you were in the countryside.</p>\r\n<p>Today for miles upon miles the four lane road separated into two lanes each\r\nway by a highway type construction concrete barrier, the roadside is packed with\r\nwall to wall shops.&nbsp; On this page is a small example of those shops.&nbsp;\r\nThe other chapters Can Tho City and the Can Tho River Market are paradise&nbsp;\r\nin the middle of nowhere and an amazing river market that has existed for 100's\r\nof years.</p>\r\n<p>At one time you crossed the various rivers by ferry, today a very modern,\r\nvery beautiful toll bridge has been built by an Australian firm, others are\r\nunder construction, but the ferry is still used in many places.&nbsp; If I were\r\na tourist alone on this trip, traveling in the Delta would be worth the price of\r\nadmission.</p>\r\n<p>Visit <a href=\"/can_tho_city.htm\">Can Tho City</a> and enjoy a trip up the\r\nriver to the 100's year old<a href=\"/can_tho_river_market.htm\"> River Market</a>.&nbsp;\r\nBring a cool one or two--it's hot</p>\r\n<p>Here are some pictures of along the way to Can Tho.</p>\r\n<table border=\"1\" width=\"100%\">\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td width=\"50%\" valign=\"top\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/creek.JPG\" width=\"320\" height=\"240\"> If there's no\r\n      river, there is always a creek.&nbsp; Little boats are everywhere here as\r\n      a primary means of transportation of everything from produce to\r\n      computers.&nbsp; I would not do my clothes in these creeks, either if you\r\n      get my drift.&nbsp; The government at all levels tries its best to be\r\n      environmentally clean, but centuries old habits are hard to break.\r\n      <p><img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/drying_incense.JPG\" width=\"320\" height=\"240\"> A lady outside her home/shop\r\n      dries incense.</p>\r\n      <p><img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/incense_drying.jpg\" width=\"325\" height=\"246\"> The\r\n      leaves to the right are tea leaves.&nbsp;

Small wonder there are not\r\n      more.&nbsp; The next few pictures give you an idea of just how cluttered\r\n      the roadside is for 150 miles and why it took five hours to go 150\r\n      miles.&nbsp; The return trip on an early Sunday morning took considerably\r\n      less time.</p>\r\n      <p><img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/store.JPG\" width=\"320\" height=\"240\"></p>\r\n      <p><img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/use.JPG\" width=\"320\" height=\"240\"></p>\r\n      <p><img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/shop_construction.JPG\" width=\"320\" height=\"240\"> Here, I wanted to get a\r\n      shot of the brick work.&nbsp;

I got out\r\n      of our van to stretch and look for the facilities (waiting in line does\r\n      take its toll).&nbsp; I passed some guys using the river.&nbsp; They just\r\n      grinned at me.&nbsp; I couldn't find any facilities, went back to where\r\n      the guys were standing in the back, determined windage, and joined\r\n      in.&nbsp; When you gotta, you gotta.</p>\r\n      <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n      <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n      <p>&nbsp;",

He was a Christian\r\n      Socialist.</p>\r\n      <p>The Pledge was published in the September 8th issue of The Youth's\r\n      Companion, the leading family magazine and the Reader's Digest of its day.</p>\r\n      <p>In 1892 Francis Bellamy was also a chairman of a committee of state\r\n      superintendents of education in the National Education Association. As its\r\n      chairman, he prepared the program for the public schools' quadricentennial\r\n      celebration for Columbus Day in 1892. He structured this public school\r\n      program around a flag raising ceremony and a flag salute.</p>\r\n      <p>In the material which he nationally circulated, he wrote, &quot;Let the\r\n      flag float over every school-house in the land and the exercise be such as\r\n      shall impress upon our youth the patriotic duty of citizenship.&quot; He\r\n      also included the original 23 words of the Pledge which he had developed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n      <p align=\"center\"></font><font color=\"#FF0000\" size=\"5\">I pledge\r\n      allegiance to my Flag, and (to*) the Republic for which it stands: one\r\n      Nation indivisible, With Liberty and Justice for all.</font></p>\r\n      <p align=\"left\"><font size=\"4\">&nbsp;* 'to' added in October, 1892.&nbsp;</p>\r\n      <p>Thus it was that on Columbus Day in October 1892, the Pledge of\r\n      Allegiance was repeated by more than 12 million public school children in\r\n      every state in the union.</p>\r\n      <p>He considered placing the word, 'equality,' in his Pledge, but knew\r\n      that the state superintendents of education on his committee were against\r\n      equality for women and African Americans.&nbsp;</p>\r\n      <p>Mr. Bellamy was asked to remove himself as a minister as his beliefs\r\n      were considered too socialist for him to continue to serve in that\r\n      capacity. He moved from his homestate of New York to Florida where he\r\n      discontinued attending Church altogether, considering it racist. He passed\r\n      away in 1931.</p>\r\n      <p>The pledge as we know it was changed three times since Mr. Bellamy\r\n      first penned it.</p>\r\n      <p>On June 14, 1923, at the First National Flag Conference held in\r\n      Washington, D.C., the 'leadership of the American Legion and the Daughters\r\n      of the American Revolution changed the Pledge's words. The words &quot;the\r\n      flag of the United States&quot; were substituted for &quot;my\r\n      flag.&quot;on the grounds that some foreign-born children and adults when\r\n      giving the Pledge might have in mind the flag of their native land.In\r\n      1923,</p>\r\n      <p>In 1924, &quot;of America&quot; was added.</p>\r\n      <p>The Pledge of Allegiance continued to be recited daily by children in\r\n      schools across America, and gained heightened popularity among adults\r\n      during the patriotic fervor created by World War II. It still was an\r\n      &quot;unofficial&quot; pledge until June 22, 1942 when the United States\r\n      Congress included the Pledge to the Flag in the United States Flag Code\r\n      (Title 36). In 1945 the Pledge to the Flag received its official title as:\r\n      The Pledge of Allegiance</p>\r\n      <p>The last change in the Pledge of Allegiance occurred on June 14 (Flag\r\n      Day), 1954 when President Dwight D. Eisenhower approved adding the words\r\n      &quot;under God&quot;. As he authorized this change he said: &quot;In this\r\n      way we are reaffirming the transcendence of religious faith in America's\r\n      heritage and future; in this way we shall constantly strengthen those\r\n      spiritual weapons which forever will be our country's most powerful\r\n      resource in peace and war.&quot;</p>\r\n      <p></font><font color=\"#FF0000\" size=\"6\">As reviewed by Red Skelton\r\n      January 14, 1969</font><font size=\"4\"></p>\r\n      <p></font><font size=\"6\"><font color=\"#004080\">I</font>....</font><font size=\"4\">\r\n      Me.

Mayo</p>\r\n<p>When do we win?</p>\r\n<p>What do we win?</p>\r\n<p>When do we leave?</p>\r\n<p>When is the phrase &quot;we are doing a lot of good over there&quot; no\r\nlonger enough to justify the next soldier KIA?</p>\r\n<p>Perhaps I am suffering from an overdose of Memorial Day weekend movies.\r\nPerhaps, I have seen (and read) &quot;We Were Soldiers Once�And Young&quot;\r\none too many times. Perhaps Americans need to talk more about &quot;the\r\nwar&quot; and just what we are getting out of it for our efforts.</p>\r\n<p>There is no good time to leave a country yours has conquered. There is no\r\nlength of time that is long enough, nor good deeds that are done enough to\r\ndetermine when a conqueror has won over &quot;the hearts and minds&quot; of the\r\npeople conquered.</p>\r\n<p>There are not enough Americans who have an interest let alone a commitment in\r\nthis war to say &quot;it�s time to come home&quot; nor to say &quot;let�s\r\nhold the line&quot;.</p>\r\n<p>The few Americans who have a real interest in staying or leaving are the ones\r\nwith sons, daughters, husbands, wives, Fathers and Mothers who are dying or\r\ncould die next for an Iraqi citizen�s freedom.</p>\r\n<p>Most of us sacrifice little for the war. Even fewer of us worry every night\r\nfor someone in Iraq.</p>\r\n<p>More than 35 years ago from a rice paddy, I wrote a letter to the editor of\r\nthe Clarion Ledger chastising &quot;the American media&quot; for its reporting\r\non &quot;my&quot; war. I outlined a lengthy list of good deeds we were doing for\r\nthe people of Vietnam. The longer I remained in Vietnam, though, the more I\r\nrealized that &quot;doing for&quot; was not the same as reducing the threat of\r\n&quot;the commies&quot; from invading the U. S. The more I re-read that letter,\r\nthe more somber about Iraq I become.</p>\r\n<p>Those people who say one cannot compare the two wars are correct. In a\r\nDemocracy such as ours, all persons, we like to think, have an equal voice. And\r\nfor nearly two hundred years, the draft offered assurance that all Americans had\r\nan equal opportunity to defend our country and our freedoms. The end of the\r\ndraft after Vietnam brought with it an end to equal opportunity to protect\r\nDemocracy and Liberty.</p>\r\n<p>Today�s volunteer army is not in the best interests of a Democracy. A\r\nvolunteer military does not allow enough people to answer the questions posed at\r\nthe beginning.</p>\r\n<p>A military draft assures all Americans have an equal opportunity to defend\r\nand die for our own liberties or someone else�s freedom from oppression. A\r\nmilitary draft assures that a president thinks twice before fabricating\r\n&quot;intelligence&quot; or allowing himself (or herself) to be duped by\r\n&quot;intelligence&quot; personnel in order to justify war. A military draft\r\nbrings Democracy to the political decision-making process to go to war.</p>\r\n<p>We are not at war in Iraq to defend our freedoms. If we were every\r\nred-blooded American male who has rattled the sword for war would line up at the\r\nrecruitment center to go off to battle to defend his loved ones. They are not.\r\nMost are deadly silent, fearing, I suspect, criticism from their friends (or\r\nworse, our government) if they openly oppose the war, or stares from people like\r\nme if they support war but watch as someone else�s Mother, Father, wife,\r\nhusband, brother, sister, son or daughter fights for freedom.</p>\r\n<p>Yes, we are doing good for Iraqis. Yes, we are bringing good water and\r\nschools to Iraqi children. And, yes, we are introducing American values to an\r\noppressed people. But, with our money, we are doing the same in Communist China\r\nwithout loss of a life. We are doing the same in Vietnam and we have not lost a\r\nlife there in more than 30 years.</p>\r\n<p>Begin a discussion by asking the primary question &quot;What are our national\r\ninterests in Iraq?&quot; Is the answer &quot;to bring freedom to the\r\nIraqis?&quot; Or, is it &quot;to protect our freedoms here at home?&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Either answer evokes the question, should not all Americans have an equal\r\nopportunity to accomplish the national goals (if there are any) on the war in\r\nIraq?</p>\r\n<p>If you have no clue�well, you�re lucky there is no draft.</p>\r\n<p>If there had been a draft, this war would have been over two years ago or\r\nnever started. Americans would have demanded an answer to the primary question\r\nand the answers to the questions posed at the beginning would have been the\r\ngoals.</p>\r\n<p>At some point &quot;doing good&quot; is not enough to justify the loss of\r\nanother American Soldier in Iraq, unless we all have an equal opportunity to die\r\nto &quot;do good&quot;.</p>\r\n<p>If Americans are not ready for an equal opportunity draft, it�s time to\r\ncall it a day and come home because most Americans sacrifice nothing for the\r\noutcome of the war, have no commitment to the war, or worse yet are just plain\r\nclueless on the war.</p>\r\n<p>The people who volunteer can�t do it alone, forever.</p>\r\n<p>John M.

</span>3 hours\r\nlater we were asking for directions.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>Look,\r\nI knew how to get there.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>We went\r\nover and stopped at two places with bridges.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp;\r\n</span>I had indeed built a bridge at both places which were eventually replaced\r\nby concrete bridges.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>Then an old man\r\nsaid he knew of a bridge that Americans built that was still there.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\"><o:p>\r\nNow as you view these pictures, any hardtop roads you see were dirt when I was\r\nthere...we called the material laterite or as some of us Southerners noted,\r\n&quot;The red clay of Georgia&quot;.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>You\r\nwill see just how wide/narrow the road was in the dirt road scene.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp;\r\n</span>Those roads have not changed.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\">In this group of pictures, you will see me with a group\r\nto townspeople.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>THEY WERE CHILDREN\r\nWHEN I BUILT THE BRIDGE!<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>I had my\r\noriginal pictures and they began yelling for friends and pointing themselves out\r\nin the pictures.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>They all remembered\r\nus doing the bridge.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>When I get hole\r\nand post the pictures on my website, you will see &quot;then&quot; and\r\n&quot;Now&quot;<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>The 287 foot bridge\r\nis now concrete, mine was timber.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\">This bridge forever changed my life, gave me direction,\r\na goal.&nbsp; Revisiting it has had a tremendous impact me today at 61.&nbsp; I\r\nwish I could describe the feeling so that you would understand just how I felt\r\nwhen these people mobbed, hugged, kissed, held my hand.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\"><o:p>\r\nYou will also see a river.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>This is a\r\nmajor tributary of the Mekong.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>From\r\nhere we launched our large rafts to carry APC's or the small ones to carry\r\ninfantry.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>You will see a picture\r\nwith a van on the road.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>This was a\r\nlarge dirt, just plain dirt path.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>We\r\nlanded our helicopters here to load up and start an assault on a position.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\"><o:p>\r\nYou will also see a modern two story school following those river pictures.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp;\r\n</span>This is a community college.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>It\r\nis built on our base camp and the first one is exactly where my platoon's\r\npositions were.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>We eventually took\r\nmatters into our own hands because every time a Chinook landed, it would lift\r\nour ten man (GP MEDIUM TENTS) out of their stakes.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp;\r\n</span>We traveled to where Mac Huddleston was stationed and stole corrugated\r\ntin roofing from the supply point for our roof and got rid of the tents.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\"><o:p>\r\nUnfortunately we were ordered by the battalion commander who saw the contraband\r\nto steal some more and pass it out---we did---we were good at what we did.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\"><o:p>\r\nYou will see a tall memorial.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>This\r\nis dedicated to the VC who died in the area.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp;\r\n</span>This spot was where we held our POW's for transfer.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\">Keep in mind, whatever you see was all rice paddies and\r\ndirt roads...all of it.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>This was a\r\nhamlet of maybe a few hundred people, now it is a town with a modern school for\r\nthe surrounding students.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/tran_and_me_at_bridge.jpg\" width=\"315\" height=\"236\">\r\nI hit the ceiling when we came to this American Bailey Bridge.&nbsp; Made of\r\nstructural aluminum, a squad can put on together like tinker toys in no\r\ntime.&nbsp; No nuts and bolts all pinned together and clamps.&nbsp; With me is\r\nTran &quot;Tony&quot; Traun, our guide and someone who was excited as I\r\nwas.&nbsp; My brother was shot in the area of this bridge in '67.&nbsp; I was\r\ntalking with him on the radio about 2 a.m. in the morning.&nbsp; His platoon and\r\na V.C. unit saw and open fired on each other about the same time.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/bailey_bridge_long_view.jpg\" width=\"318\" height=\"238\">\r\nDepending on the length of the bridge, you can add eight foot panels to\r\nstrengthen the bridge.&nbsp; For example, this is a double, double with two\r\npanels side-by-side and two high.&nbsp; The largest you can go is a triple,\r\ntriple.</p>\r\n<table border=\"1\" width=\"100%\">\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td width=\"50%\" bgcolor=\"#000000\">\r\n      <p align=\"center\"><font size=\"5\" color=\"#FFFFFF\">Before</font>",

While he was at the M.A.S.H unit, I visited him.\r\n&nbsp; He had the prettiest nurse taking care of him.&nbsp; She was a Georgia peach for\r\nsure.&nbsp; He has no recollection of her....too bad.&nbsp; Mike has two Legion of Merits,\r\nthe highest award for Service or Achievement in the Army, a Bronze Star,\r\nVietnamese Cross of Gallantry, two Purple Hearts.

We connected the hook to the APC and\r\nthe helicopter lifted\r\njust enough to get the men out from under the carrier.&nbsp; Three died, six were\r\ninjured.&nbsp; The helicopter landed and we loaded the wounded and dead onto it and\r\nit flew to a hospital.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the way back up river with the damaged carrier and two others, water almost swamped\r\nthe raft.&nbsp; We came under attack by machine-gun fire and rifle grenades. I called in\r\nsome gunships that were trailing us.&nbsp; They lit up the riverbank like the Fourth of\r\nJuly.&nbsp; What a site!&nbsp; All the pictures are\r\n&quot;thumbnails&quot;.&nbsp; To see a larger version, double click the small\r\npicture.</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"1\" width=\"100%\">\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td width=\"15%\"><a href=\"/images/raft_docking.jpg\"><img src=\"/images/raft_docking_small.jpg\" alt=\"raft docking.jpg (30451 bytes)\" border=\"2\" WIDTH=\"100\" HEIGHT=\"97\"></a><br>\r\n    <p><a href=\"/images/viet_on_raft.jpg\"><img src=\"/images/viet_on_raft_small.jpg\" alt=\"viet on raft.jpg (26939 bytes)\" border=\"2\" WIDTH=\"100\" HEIGHT=\"66\"></a></p>\r\n    <p>&nbsp;",
