<p>If you visit this page, pass it on.&nbsp; This column appeared in the
Clarksdale Press Register where I live and the Clarion Ledger, Mississippi's
statewide newspaper.</p>
<p>You can support our troops and question this war at the same time.&nbsp; I am
a four time decorated Vietnam Veteran.&nbsp; I have no misgivings about
war.&nbsp; At times they are necessary.&nbsp; But, the United States does not
need to send American men and women to a country because their people are
oppressed.&nbsp; There are far more oppressed people in this world than Iraq and
yet we turn blind eyes to the human atrocities that occur in those countries...</p>
<p>Here's my column.&nbsp; Pass it on and question and discuss the goals of the
war...if you can name them and whether or not they are worth the life of another
American soldier and if they are, I urge you to support a military
draft.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Folks, I spent 18 months in Vietnam, 13 of them in line combat and the other
five training replacements for their first combat patrol.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are good at kicking butt; but, we should leave the nation building to
someone else.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>My position is--institute the draft or bring the troops home, use our money
to rebuild the country, and institute the military draft any time our troops go
on one of these excursions for more than six months.</p>

<p>Question Iraq<br>
by John M. Mayo</p>
<p>When do we win?</p>
<p>What do we win?</p>
<p>When do we leave?</p>
<p>When is the phrase "we are doing a lot of good over there" no
longer enough to justify the next soldier KIA?</p>
<p>Perhaps I am suffering from an overdose of Memorial Day weekend movies.
Perhaps, I have seen (and read) "We Were Soldiers Once…And Young"
one too many times. Perhaps Americans need to talk more about "the
war" and just what we are getting out of it for our efforts.</p>
<p>There is no good time to leave a country yours has conquered. There is no
length of time that is long enough, nor good deeds that are done enough to
determine when a conqueror has won over "the hearts and minds" of the
people conquered.</p>
<p>There are not enough Americans who have an interest let alone a commitment in
this war to say "it’s time to come home" nor to say "let’s
hold the line".</p>
<p>The few Americans who have a real interest in staying or leaving are the ones
with sons, daughters, husbands, wives, Fathers and Mothers who are dying or
could die next for an Iraqi citizen’s freedom.</p>
<p>Most of us sacrifice little for the war. Even fewer of us worry every night
for someone in Iraq.</p>
<p>More than 35 years ago from a rice paddy, I wrote a letter to the editor of
the Clarion Ledger chastising "the American media" for its reporting
on "my" war. I outlined a lengthy list of good deeds we were doing for
the people of Vietnam. The longer I remained in Vietnam, though, the more I
realized that "doing for" was not the same as reducing the threat of
"the commies" from invading the U. S. The more I re-read that letter,
the more somber about Iraq I become.</p>
<p>Those people who say one cannot compare the two wars are correct. In a
Democracy such as ours, all persons, we like to think, have an equal voice. And
for nearly two hundred years, the draft offered assurance that all Americans had
an equal opportunity to defend our country and our freedoms. The end of the
draft after Vietnam brought with it an end to equal opportunity to protect
Democracy and Liberty.</p>
<p>Today’s volunteer army is not in the best interests of a Democracy. A
volunteer military does not allow enough people to answer the questions posed at
the beginning.</p>
<p>A military draft assures all Americans have an equal opportunity to defend
and die for our own liberties or someone else’s freedom from oppression. A
military draft assures that a president thinks twice before fabricating
"intelligence" or allowing himself (or herself) to be duped by
"intelligence" personnel in order to justify war. A military draft
brings Democracy to the political decision-making process to go to war.</p>
<p>We are not at war in Iraq to defend our freedoms. If we were every
red-blooded American male who has rattled the sword for war would line up at the
recruitment center to go off to battle to defend his loved ones. They are not.
Most are deadly silent, fearing, I suspect, criticism from their friends (or
worse, our government) if they openly oppose the war, or stares from people like
me if they support war but watch as someone else’s Mother, Father, wife,
husband, brother, sister, son or daughter fights for freedom.</p>
<p>Yes, we are doing good for Iraqis. Yes, we are bringing good water and
schools to Iraqi children. And, yes, we are introducing American values to an
oppressed people. But, with our money, we are doing the same in Communist China
without loss of a life. We are doing the same in Vietnam and we have not lost a
life there in more than 30 years.</p>
<p>Begin a discussion by asking the primary question "What are our national
interests in Iraq?" Is the answer "to bring freedom to the
Iraqis?" Or, is it "to protect our freedoms here at home?"</p>
<p>Either answer evokes the question, should not all Americans have an equal
opportunity to accomplish the national goals (if there are any) on the war in
Iraq?</p>
<p>If you have no clue…well, you’re lucky there is no draft.</p>
<p>If there had been a draft, this war would have been over two years ago or
never started. Americans would have demanded an answer to the primary question
and the answers to the questions posed at the beginning would have been the
goals.</p>
<p>At some point "doing good" is not enough to justify the loss of
another American Soldier in Iraq, unless we all have an equal opportunity to die
to "do good".</p>
<p>If Americans are not ready for an equal opportunity draft, it’s time to
call it a day and come home because most Americans sacrifice nothing for the
outcome of the war, have no commitment to the war, or worse yet are just plain
clueless on the war.</p>
<p>The people who volunteer can’t do it alone, forever.</p>
