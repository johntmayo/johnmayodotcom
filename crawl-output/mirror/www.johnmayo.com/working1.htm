<p>Our unit had several roles to perform.&nbsp; We provided demolition support when
infantry units went on patrol.&nbsp; When you watch war movies and see guys running from
one bunker to another throwing in satchel charges, you're watching combat engineers at
work.&nbsp; We provided mine sweeping, bridge building, and rafting.&nbsp; Ever see
&quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot; and the assault across the river?&nbsp; You were watching
combat engineers at work.&nbsp; We provided rafts that carried ten men for across river
assaults, light tactical aluminum rafts for running a tank onto a shore, and heavier rafts
for floating 2-3 Armored personnel carriers down a river.</p>

<p>On one occasion, we were about to hit the bank when an explosion on land turned over an
APC carrying a squad of infantry.&nbsp; Nine were pinned under the APC.&nbsp; I had a
sister platoon building a bridge further south of us.&nbsp; Flying over was a Chinook
carrying a sling load of material to the platoon.&nbsp; I called the pilot who dropped his
load, flew over to us, dropped his hook and sling. We connected the hook to the APC and
the helicopter lifted
just enough to get the men out from under the carrier.&nbsp; Three died, six were
injured.&nbsp; The helicopter landed and we loaded the wounded and dead onto it and
it flew to a hospital.</p>

<p>On the way back up river with the damaged carrier and two others, water almost swamped
the raft.&nbsp; We came under attack by machine-gun fire and rifle grenades. I called in
some gunships that were trailing us.&nbsp; They lit up the riverbank like the Fourth of
July.&nbsp; What a site!&nbsp; All the pictures are

    <td width="85%" valign="top">This is the raft I was referring to, but this was a different
    mission.&nbsp; We assemble these things.&nbsp; The pontoons the structure floats on are
    chambered and can can take a number of hits before completely deflating.&nbsp; I'll put it
    this way, on the incident I explained above, water was making it over the tops of the
    pontoon...we were nearly sucking air.&nbsp; The raft is pushed by one or two push boats
    that had a lot of horsepower.&nbsp; We had machine guns on them in the event we had to
    untie one in order to attack an emplacement on a bank.&nbsp; We did that more than once.
    &nbsp;&nbsp; This is what we called an M4T6 raft.<p>We pretty much protected ourselves on
    the river.&nbsp; </td>

    <td width="85%" valign="top">The picture is a bit blurry, but compared to the above raft
    this one is lighter and the pontoons are aluminum and can be lifted by 4-6 men. &nbsp;
    They are pushed by boats, also. But, in this case, we get everyone off the APCs and have
    them pull the raft across the river.&nbsp; In this case we inserted APCs onto an inland
    island surrounded by three rivers or parts of rivers.&nbsp; The island was about 10,000
    acres and the home of a VC regiment.&nbsp; On another page you will see a bridge we built
    to gain access the the area.<p>In the middle picture you get an idea of where we loaded
    the APCs and to the right is the remnants of a bridge the Viet Minh destroyed</p>
    <p>The lower picture is where we docked the raft.&nbsp; Wherever we went, villagers would
    gather.&nbsp; That was a good sign.&nbsp; If they were there, we were relatively safe.
    &nbsp; If not, we took it as a sure sign the VC were around.&nbsp; </td>

    opposite shore.&nbsp; If we were doing a river assault, we had three of my engineers in
    the raft who were experienced and then a squad (10) of infantry.&nbsp; Everyone
    paddled...fast.&nbsp; Assaulting was usually not a problem.&nbsp; Coming back was because
    only three men paddled back against the river current.&nbsp; This meant you stayed along
    unfriendly shores and went up stream a ways, and then vectored across and down the river
    using the current to hit the home shore.<p>The lower picture is us preparing the rafts for
    the assault.&nbsp; In the background center, left is a Vietnamese craft.&nbsp; The craft
    was blown up by VC sappers a few days before this picture was taken.</p>

    the elephant leaves, anywhere.&nbsp; Most times we had helicopters trailing us, other
    times I just took one of the push boats and let it run up and down the river trying to
    draw fire.&nbsp; If we were moving two APC's, we would have some 25-30 men on the raft and
    the equipment.&nbsp; That was a good, somewhat defenseless target of opportunity.</td>

    was a tidal river and had some good currents.&nbsp; The boat was powered by a small
    outboard, or a person in the rear paddling.&nbsp; Fish and shrimp were either scooped into
    the net, or actually moved into it with the current.&nbsp; I have seen similar boats on
    the Gulf Coast operated by Vietnamese.</td>
