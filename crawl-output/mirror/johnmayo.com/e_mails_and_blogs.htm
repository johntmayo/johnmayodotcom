<p>While visiting Vietnam, I sent e mails to my e mail list of some 1300
persons.&nbsp; I also sent blogs to the Clarion Ledger newspaper.&nbsp; I am
posting them here as I wrote them.&nbsp; There are references to pictures which
I sent along with the e mails.&nbsp; I am not reposting those pictures as most
are located somewhere in the website.</p>
<p>E Mails</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">First Full Day</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Welcome, to Mississippi
East.&nbsp; Hot, muggy, dripping sweat, showers in the afternoon.&nbsp; We're at
start of rainy season where it rains in Saigon atr least two hours each
afternoon.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Much has changed, most has
not.&nbsp; A lot of co0nstruction, road building, ultra modern buildings in
central business district,&nbsp; Hotels are same on outside, but very modern
inside.&nbsp; Most built by French.&nbsp; Oldest in 1893, three more incl;uding
ours from 1900 to 1930.&nbsp; But still modern inside, GREAT service...and the
prices...they're not cheap.&nbsp; In fact don't think you're coming to a country
where you can get stuff cheap.&nbsp; Our lunch today was $20 each, could have
gotten much less has we chosen to carve up a chicken hanging out on the street,</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Got here Tuesday night
(our day here).&nbsp; At 11:30 p.m. passed the Cathedral downtown built more
than 100 years ago by French...Scores of people were outside praying.&nbsp; Did
not look to be organized...just praying.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Expected to see A LOT of
military, but besides custom have only seen one jeep all day long.&nbsp; It was
one of ours and looked brand new.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Went to Cho Lon--Chinatown
here, and several other markets,&nbsp; There's no way to forget them.&nbsp;
CROWDED as always, anything and everything for sale from gold to fish and
vegetables, cloth of all kinds, cookware, you name it.&nbsp; And Haggling--Also
the smells--a mixture of foods cooking, bread bakingm charcoal burning, and
people doing their business, but I have to say they were clean.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I was going into one
public place and three ladies yelled at me...&quot;Sir, Sir, one dollar,
please.&quot;&nbsp; Yes, nothing is free.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Went to the US embassy,
now consulate.&nbsp; Was a simple plaque on the outside of the wall, actually on
sidewalk commemorating the Viet Cong soldiers who died for victory on the lawn
during Tet of '68.&nbsp; I remember well the shape of the buildings at that time
and the soccer field nearby which was a battleground area.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Oh, when we got here last
night, we went up to the rooftop garden lounge.&nbsp; We are staying at the Rex
Hotel. It was after midnight, a Vietnamese band was playing US songs.&nbsp; I
remembered, I have been here before.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Next Email</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Goooooooood Morning,
Mississippi</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">It's 5:30 a.m. Friday
morning here---from Vietnam&nbsp;</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Goooooooooood, Morning
Mississippi!</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Wow, it's great to be
alive!&nbsp; We are going into the Mekong Delta and where I spent 12 of my 18
months in Vietnam.&nbsp; If it is like yesterday, there will be a lot of
changes.&nbsp; I just could not believe the sprawl.&nbsp; Stopped at a roadside
fruit stand to get mangroves and other native fruits...I passed.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Our guide has been
GREAT.&nbsp; Young man, 31...went to University here to major in tourism.&nbsp;
Their school year and grades are identical to ours.&nbsp; BUT--and something I
agree with--once you graduate from&nbsp;high school&nbsp;you have a choice to
make---university or two years in the military. Either get an education or serve
your country before going to work.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Your opportunites here are
not dictated by the state.&nbsp; You can do what you want.&nbsp; Except for
those industries of national impact--oil, transportation, the like---private
business is private.&nbsp; Headlines in yesterday's paper was signing of
agreements between U.S. companies and Vietnam for business ventures.&nbsp; The
businesses will be owned by the businesses.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">With 8.5 million people in
this city alone and more than a million around, there are opportunities.&nbsp;
KFC is the only fast food franchise spread out over the city.&nbsp; I saw ad for
one Pizza Hut in a high end office building.&nbsp; Some of the newer buildings
are very modern, glass structures.&nbsp; If I remember will include a picture of
one just for Agnes (The Diamond Plaza).</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">As to the food.&nbsp;
Except for evening meal in hotel (and except for one night, I have chosen
Vietnamese--first night I just had to have SPAGHETTI!) have eaten on the local
&quot;economy&quot;. Food tastes great, have lost perhaps a couple pounds due to
low fat food.&nbsp; I've eaten a lot of it!</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Will include picture of
second course soup serving of shrimp, noodles, broth, fresh vegetables.&nbsp;
The soup is in cocoanut shell.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Some observations:&nbsp;
AT our consulate yesterday morning was HUGE, I mean HUGE crowd of people waiting
to obtain a VISA.&nbsp; Guide says that everyone wants to come to U.S. to see
family or attend college.&nbsp; The world hates us---but it is where the world
wants to go.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Went by the water
treatment plant--Trudy Fisher of DEQ and Dr. Thompson at Dept of Health--when I
was here, it was a lone structure on a hill protected by tanks (armored, not
water) with plenty of expanse around it.&nbsp; Today it is sprawled and there is
no open ground to be seen anywhere.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Ads:&nbsp; from huge
billboards to small store signs there is a mixture of Vietnamese and English
signage.&nbsp; What's noticeable is the omnipresence and use of the western,
idealized (by men&nbsp; of course) women to grab attention for everything from
computers to hair design.&nbsp; The Vietnamese women pictures in some ads all
are made up to look lke western women--short skirts, cleavage (I notice
everything) facial make up.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Businessmen here where
suits, women where appropriate dress or business outfits.&nbsp; Have seen (and
very, very few) eamples of &quot;plumbers cracks&quot; either in the your men or
women.&nbsp; Many, Many people are dressed &quot;like us&quot; on
streets---comfortable jeans or slacks, pullovers.&nbsp; I think I was the only
person (male) I saw wearing shorts yesterday.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Here's some
pictures:&nbsp; 2 is a tv on plane...watched 3 movies.&nbsp; This is one mapping
the progress of plane from Atlanta, to Canada, Alaska, and then dipping down to
Korea.&nbsp; 6 is airport in Korea (Inchon/Seoul), 14 is view from the rooftop
Garden of hotel;</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">23 is the Continental
Hotel---car bombed during the war, 31 is the inside of the post office.&nbsp; I
do not have an email quality outside picture to send, but it was built by French
way early last century and around the building are plaques naming outstanding
French scientists, except for one of them...any guess as to who?&nbsp; If you
said ol' Ben Franklin, you would be right...The French all but worshipped him
and he the French women.&nbsp; picture 36 is Notre Dame Cathedral across street
from Post office.&nbsp; Daily Mass is still offered here.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">51 is inside one of the
markets we went to.&nbsp; I wish I could describe the size of the place,
compactness of the stalls, and especially the smell.&nbsp; EVERYTHING is sold in
here including (literally) the Kitchen sink.&nbsp; Kitchen pots and pans, cloth
(more raw cloth than you'll ever see in your life in one place), clothes, fish
(live), fresh vegetables, fruits, cooked food.&nbsp; Wal Mart must have gotten
its inspiration from here.&nbsp; 52 is the outside of the market (this building
is nearly 100 years old), 63 is an example of the wiring grid both telephone and
electrical prevcalent in Saigon except in the hotel area.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">109 is the presentation
for the soup course and tea totalers---YOU WILL learn to develop a taste for
beer or risk Montezuma's revenge, 111 is the presentation cocoanut shell open to
dip out the soup, and the last one, 116, is a barge in the background and an old
man plying the Saigon river in his boat.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Well, that's it for this
morning.&nbsp; In a couple of hours am going to the Delta.&nbsp; Am really
looking forward to this part of the trip.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">John</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">More, later.</font></p>
<font FACE="Tahoma" SIZE="2">
<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;</p>
</font>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Next one:</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">End Of Day</font></p>
<font SIZE="3">
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Traffic is organized
chaos.&nbsp; Trust me on this...you might think you can drive in any condition,
but, trust me, I know of no one who could make it on the streets over
here.&nbsp; Watching from the roof top restaurant last night, the scene below
looked like orchestrated ballet, without the conductor.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">No traffic police, no
traffic lights, but at a major intersection, thousands of motorcycles made it
through.&nbsp; In one 30 second period, counted 57 motorbikes, one car.&nbsp;
Now, that was just in one lane going one way on a four lane boulevard.&nbsp;
That does not count oncoming, crossing, or traffic going in the wrong direction
and at 9:30 at night.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The main boulevards are
beautiful with parks separating the opposing lanes, with trees, gardens, and
sculptures in the central business district.&nbsp;This morning at 6, people were
playing bamitton for exercise in the traffic! Side streets and areas out side of
CBD is quite the opposite, narrow, congested, everyman and woman for themselves,
driver (any driver) seems to have the right away.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">On the streets and in the
hotels, everyone says good morning, smiles, very friendly.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Went to a pagoda on our
trip yesterday.&nbsp; Part of it was roof covered, part exposed to the sky and
there was an afternoon shower.&nbsp; Incense burning.&nbsp; There was a sense of
deep reverance and you could really feel it.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Also went to a
&quot;factory&quot; where handicapped persons, mostly veterans (have I said this
before...losing track of time) design and make the Mother-of-pearl inlaid
pictures, jewelry boxes, jewelry that you see.&nbsp; Unbelievable
craftsmanship.&nbsp; It is all really done by hand, from washing the pearl
shells, duck egg shells, to chipping, peeling, affixing painting.&nbsp; I've
always thought &quot;handmade&quot; meant someone turned the machine on.&nbsp;
Real people really do make those items.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">From the government
buildings yesterday, the country's flag waved.&nbsp; A single gold star against
a red background.&nbsp; The flag the North Vietnamese had.&nbsp; Really didn't
matter to or bother me.&nbsp; At supper last night atop the hotel on Rooftop
Garden Restaurant, you could make out the Continental Hotel a couple blocks
away.&nbsp; You can imagine during the war American officers, senior enlisted,
and diplomats housed at the Rex where&nbsp;I am staying having breakfast four
decades ago and hearing, seeing the Continental car bombed early on in the war
and how they must have felt.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Across the street, the
Vietnamese flag was lighted and waving.&nbsp; It mattered.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Despite your feelings on
that, you have to hand it to the Vietnamese people.&nbsp; Through 1,000-1,500 or
more years of history they have been occupied by one foreign country or another
for the better part of their existence; yet, as a people they have
persevered.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">They are extremely hard
workers.&nbsp; Did see a number of street people, but in a city of 8.5 million
you would be surprised not to.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">John</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Next One</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Can Tho</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">We are in the heart of the
Mekong Delta...Can Tho...The largest city (one million) in the Delta and the
last big city before reaching Cambodia about 2 hours or less away. Can Tho is
150 miles from Saigon but it took us nearly five to get here. traffic was
horrendous. I cannot even begin to describe bumper to bumper, no man's land
passing, 1o's of thousands of mopeds...Have you ever scene a family of husband,
wife, and two children on one of these things. How about one carrying a washing
machine, and another with five dogs. Get this...three on a threesided basket in
back, one across the gas tank, and the other in the driver's lap...he was taking
them the obedience school!</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">And the shops...150 miles
gain of one after another in very few spaces only an honest to God's factory
filled the gap. There is no zoning, little interference from the government.
Incidentally we were told sales tax is 10% and income tax is a flat 10% no
deductions.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">You pay to go to public
school (about $200 a year) except for pre k which is 40 a month because the kids
get two meals. Also if you are too poor to pay, here's how they handle it. The
village or district government of a city know who is really poor and they will
write a letter to the school asking the child be allowed in.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Also, if you are old and
poor, your children must take care of you. If they cannot, you go to live at a
hostel. If you are the poor parents of children, they go to an orphanage. Health
care is not free and according to our guide their is no free food nor transfer
payments to the poor.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">We could not find or the
guide did not want to go to the base camp we wanted to go to. I have to tell
you---Mac Huddleston and Mac Gordon will know this, this aina't your Daddy's
army days Mekong Delta. The pot holed two lane highway is four lane. There are
no open areas with rice paddies, swamps, or palm tree jungles. It is wall to
wall shsops the whole way. Despite the crowded conditions, I did recognize the
turn off for the basecamp, only because the once two lane original bridge going
into Tan An is still there along with another two laner in opposite direction.
We made it clear in no uncertain terms to the guide, we would take a left hand
turn outside Tan An on the way back.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Mac, if Dong Tam is still
there, I and you would not know it. Our guide did take us to a site where the VC
overwhelmed an ARVN (Army of Republic of Vietnam--The &quot;good guys&quot;) in
1963. Some 200 ARVH soldiers were killed with their three US advisors. The
helicopter shot down is displayed (or one like it) and around what is left of
the defensive areas are displays of where a chopper went down, APC burned, or
bomb dropped. If I am not mistaken while it was a wiwn for the VC, it was the
battle that eventually brought in regular US troops. I believe, this was the one
where the advisors had to plead with the area commander to commit more ARVN
troops and he would not. The request went up to HQ iin Saigon and they refused
reinforcements.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Eventually the decision
was made by US commanders that if we were to be iin this war, US troops would
have to fight it. I hope we have learned a lesson from that battle that if a
country requesting our aid refuses to mobilize, train, pay, and commit their
forces first, we are better off to back off from the invite.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I have often railed aboput
the (I know I will mispell) beugiosse--I won't even attempt living the high life
among the little people, but iin Can Tho, we are staying at a nice, a very nice
hotel. Can Tho is a much cleaner city it appears than Saigon, of course it onl;y
has a million people to &quot;control&quot;.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Here's some more pictures.
As I attach them, I'll explain 125 are some homes amongst the squalor for the
richer.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">128 are women and older
men working in a rice paddy. Like the US, somethings are the same. Our guide
told us that younger people do not like the hardwork. This work use to be women
only, now older men must do, too. They are planting rice plants by hand. 132 is
a family plot in the middle of the rice field. You these then and now dotted all
over the country side in the middle of fields. My unit was attacked by RPG's
from behind a group of crypts. I called for artillery which would not fire and
dustoff helicopters would not come in to take out our wounded until we
suppressed the firing. I did thenn, and feel sorry to some extant now for the
families of the dead in those crypts. I had 106 mm jeep mounted recoiless rifles
which were very accurate.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">By the way, in Vietnam,
couples are allowed by government to have two children. !8 is the age for women,
21 for men to marry. In the city, both men and women wait until they have
establ;ished themselves with a good job and decent apartment before marrying and
put off starting a family. In the country, they do manage to marry earlier, do
not put off having children, and by 25 they have three.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">We did get of the main
road to go to the war memorial and picture 135 is a country road and is what the
main road looked like 40 years ago. This one would have been dirt. 145 is rice
being put on the road to dry. Prior to this they would have through stalk, chaff
and all into the air. The rice being heavier would fall, the rest blow away. 149
is an interesting one. We decided these &quot;MIGHT&quot; be punji stakes. The
ends are sharpened, they are pointed in the same angle, they are barely out of
the water, and they are hardwood. They are in the area of the battle I described
earlier and would have blocked soldiers coming across the creek to aid the
attacking or besieged troops.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">185 is a shop that looks
just like the thousands of other shops lining the road, 164 is a ladt making
incence that you might be burning next week, 188 are more shops, and 213 are
actually nicer shops by the restaurant we ate at.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Again, there's much more,
but if you got this far, I hope you don't mind me sending pictures. The internet
has made this so easy. I am at the hotel, but even iin the backwater towns here,
they have access to wireless internet &quot;cafes&quot; everywhere.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">John</font></p>
<font FACE="Consolas" SIZE="3">
<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;</p>
</font>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Next One:</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">By the Way</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Our guide's wife is a
teacher of pre-k through 3rd grade.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">She makes $100 a month,
university educated. He will make more than that in tips for this trip of
six-seven days work.</font></p>
<font FACE="Consolas" SIZE="3">
<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;</p>
</font>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Next One</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Discovered basecamp</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Sunday Night 9:33
p.m.---9:33 a.m. Mississippi time</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I cannot begin to describe
to you the morning. We were coming back from Can Tho, our guide said he and the
driver now knew the way to Tan Tru. 3 hours later we were asking for directions.
Look, I knew how to get there. We went over and stopped at two places with
bridges. I had indeed built a bridge at both places which were eventually
replaced by concrete bridges. Then an old man said he knew of a bridge that
Americans built that was still there.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Now as you view these
pictures, any hardtop roads you see were dirt when I was there...we called the
material laterite or as some of us Southerners noted, &quot;The red clay of
georgia&quot;. On this or the next group of pictures you will see just how
wide/narrow the road was in the dirt road scene. Those roads have not changed.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In this group of pictures,
you will see me with a group to townspeople. THEY WERE CHILDREN WHEN I BUILT THE
BRIDGE! I had my original pictures and they began yelling for friends and
pointing themselves out in the pictures. They all remembered us doing the
bridge. When I get hole and post the pictures on my website, you will see
&quot;then&quot; and &quot;Now&quot; The 287 foot bridge is now concrete, mine
was timber.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">You will also see a river.
This is a major tributary of the Mekong. From here we launched our large rafts
to carry APC's or the small ones to carry infantry. You will see a picture with
a van on the road. This was a large dirt, just plain dirt path. We landed our
helicopters here to load up and start an assault on a position.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">You will also see a modern
two story school following those river pictures. This is a community college. It
is built on our basecamp and the first one is exactly where my platoon's
positions were. We eventually took matters into our own hands because every time
a Chinook landed, it would lift our ten man (GP MEDIUM TENTS) out of their
stakes. We travelled to where Mac Huddleston was stationed and stole corrugated
tin roofing from the supply point for our roof and got rid of the tents.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Unfortunately we were
ordered by the battalion commander who saw the contraband to steal some more and
pass it out---we did---we were good at what we did.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">You will see a tall
memorial. This is dedicated to the VC who died in the area. This spot was where
we held our POW's for transfer.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Keep in mind, whatever you
see was all rice paddies and dirt roads...all of it. This was a hamlet of maybe
a few hundred people, now it is a town with a modern school for the surrounding
students.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I hope you enjoy the
pictures. The people everywhere were very, very, nice to us and you will see as
I was taking pictures, children jumped in and wanted theirs taken, too.</font></p>

      Capitol, but I am able to get some.&nbsp; Today was a very very good
      day.&nbsp; As you can see what I told Agnes, I had to convince our guide
      that once I arrived at a certain location, I could drive myself.&nbsp; One
      of the last pictures is a nice looking building, a school building.&nbsp;
      All of this was rice paddies, all of it.&nbsp; That building literally
      sits on my &quot;hole&quot; in a rice paddy during the dry season.&nbsp;
      All the roads you see were dirt roads (I am going to bring a lump of dirt
      home).&nbsp; The river shot is where we launched our large and small
      assault rafts.&nbsp; The people around me actually recognized them selves
      in the original pictures I brought.&nbsp; I readily recognized one
      &quot;child&quot; as she had a split lip and still does...they were very
      excited...and I was, too.</span></font></p>

        pictures of our hotel in Can Tho AND---my bridges...after some
        &quot;discussion&quot;&nbsp; I kept telling&nbsp;the guide&nbsp;how to
        get there and he kept stopping for asking for directions.&nbsp; All but
        one have been replaced,&nbsp; The metal one is the furtherest.&nbsp; We
        turned around there to go to Saigon.&nbsp; But, I said in a humble
        American Arrogance, please take a right in .5 kilometer.&nbsp; Go 1.5
        Kilometers.&nbsp; If there is not a sharp right follwed by a sharp left
        and a river staring at you in the middle of the hamlet, we'll quit.</font></p>

        seeing my original pictures all came running and picked themselves out
        as children!&nbsp; What a gathering.&nbsp; A lady recognized her home
        next to the bridge and when I started taking pictures under the bridge,
        kids came running to take their's too.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">One of the most
gratifying moments of my life occurred yesterday morning.&nbsp; Sunday---it is
now Monday morning 6:30 a.m. as I write this.</font></font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;After a discussion
with our guide&nbsp;while we were mired &quot;in the boonies&quot; with him
trying to find a place on my &quot;operations map&quot;, I convinced him to take
a right, go 1.5 kilometers and if there were not a sharp right turn in the road
in the middle of a hamlet followed immediately by a sharp left and BANG, your at
a river, we could turn around and go back to Saigon.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;As we entered the
hamlet, now a town with all the thatched hooches&nbsp; gone, there it was, the
turn, the &quot;S&quot; turn, the river.&nbsp; A timber bridge I built 41 years
ago with 11 men is gone, replaced by a concrete structure.&nbsp; Gone are all
the hooches that were there, the huge thatched rice storage house, all replaced
by tin buildings.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;But there was a
stucco home on the upside of the bridge where my medic played guitar to
entertain the children.&nbsp; There was the river flowing as fast as ever, and
there were people, people who were children when my men built this bridge.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;When I pulled out my
41 year old Kodak moments, they began calling for people and soon we had a crowd
of laughing women and puzzled men.&nbsp; They recognized themselves in my
pictures.&nbsp; They are now 50-55 years old.&nbsp; People were hugging me,
laughing, passing my half dozen or so pictures around.&nbsp; Showing me who they
were in the pictures, they held their hands over their mouths and gasped and
then let out with a laugh.&nbsp; They remembered, as I had, when we built that
bridge 40 years ago last summer</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;I had one of myself
and four of the guys in the platoon chilling out back at our basecamp in another
hamlet with some Carling Black Label.&nbsp; They pointed me out skinny body and
all.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;When I began
taking pictures of the underside of the bridge, a group of children jumped into
the picture, and then more.&nbsp; I might return in 40 years to show them what
they looked like, and then again, I might just be a feeble old man of 101
telling anyone who will listen about a bridge I built in Vietnam to link two
parts of a hamlet.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;Thank you, God.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Trip to 9<sup>th</sup>
Infantry Division Base Camp</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Don't worry (as if you
might).&nbsp; I am ok.&nbsp; Today as we I went to our old army base and found
what was left of the berm, and went through the traffic, I came to a near death
experience.&nbsp; It was awful, frightening, I was scared out of wits when it
occured.&nbsp; I could not believe I attempted it.&nbsp; I thought sure half way
through the experience Steve Holland and Earle Banks would be on the next flight
to Saigon.&nbsp; Thank you, Jesus, for my quick recovery.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;I crossed a street
in Saigon at 8:45 p.m. tonight trying to obtain my First Coca Cola and Chips.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;Remember what I said
about I didn't think anyone back home could drive over here?&nbsp; Well, let me
add, only the brave, dumbfounded, or starving would dare attempt crossing eight
lanes.&nbsp; No wonder these are boulevards.&nbsp; There two lanes going one
way, a grassy median, four lanes of two each in opposite directions, a grassy
median, then two more lanes in an opposite direction of the first two.&nbsp; The
medians are a necessity for heart checks and rest!</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;We left Saigon today
going north and east.&nbsp; Now, as I remember it, once out of Saigon, it was
all rice paddies, open fields, rubber plantations to our base camp, but nooooo.&nbsp;
It's all built up with shops for 20 miles.&nbsp;&nbsp;The shops are no more than
20 feet wide, if that and on each side share a common wall.&nbsp; Will post
pictures on my website when I return.&nbsp; Imagine this scene from Jackson to
Madison up HWY 51.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;I did find the 9th
Div Basecamp.&nbsp; Could not tell what, if anything, is left as it is now a
Vietnamese army camp.&nbsp; There was a berm that was probably what is left of
our original perimeter berm.&nbsp; Trees are growing on it and what was once
400-1000 meters of free fire zone we cleared is now a mangrove plantation.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;Also large amounts
of tapioca farming going on.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;I am going to attach
some pictures here and will try to give an explanation.&nbsp; I made a lot of
notes, but I'll do them in the morning time here.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is now 9:24
p.m. and you all are about 11 hours behind us.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;Incidentally for
Representatives Sid, Mac, and Billy--there are remants of Long Binh left, but
most of it is now a High Tech Industrial park.&nbsp; FYI--Long Binh had largest
above ground ammo supply in world--Vietnamese Army now has their ammo stored
there, and Long Binh was central to all admin and supply for area around and
south of Saigon.</font></p>
