<p>Vietnam was a beautiful country and Saigon was often referred to as the &quot;Paris of
the Orient&quot; before the war.&nbsp; Most of the people were friendly and most just
wanted to be left alone and not be bothered by either us or the VC.&nbsp; Any struggle for
independence or maintaining of the status quo is not really a struggle for
&quot;freedom&quot;, but a struggle for power.&nbsp; One side wants to stay in control of
that power and another side wants to put them out so they can have it.&nbsp; That is the
essence of a civil war.&nbsp; In between are those people who get shafted by both sides.

<p>Here are some pictures of the countryside, villages, and Saigon. All the

    <td width="86%" valign="top" height="103">If I recollect correctly, from our basecamp
    there was Binh Hoa, Long Binh, and than Saigon.&nbsp; Binh Hoa was a town of a couple
    thousand, I believe.&nbsp; Long Binh was a huge logistics base for the military in the
    southern part of South Viet Nam.&nbsp; The famed LBJ (Long Binh Jail) was named after the
    initials of the president at the time Lyndon Baines Johnson.</td>

    Saigon.&nbsp; A lot of the money was in this part of Saigon.&nbsp; Much of this section
    was torched during the Tet Offensive.&nbsp; The Vietnamese, even the North Vietnamese
    despised the Chinese. &nbsp; Vietnam as a whole country in its millenium of existence had
    only had 200 years of rule by its own people.</td>

    many of the women wore a more traditional ao dai (I know I got that wrong), something like
    a black pajama style pants suit under a flowing light white gown.</td>

    Notice the shanties over the river and the somewhat nicer homes up on the hill. &nbsp;
    Saigon is just like any other city in the world.&nbsp; A downtown, old city, suburbs, nice
    neighborhoods, and rundown ones.&nbsp; There are mom and pop stores and big department
    stores.&nbsp; I went to one of the department stores.&nbsp; It was owned by the president
    or his family and on one of the floors there was farm implement products for sale with the
    stamp &quot;Donated by the People of the United States to the People of South
    Vietnam&quot;.&nbsp; So much for helping out an impoverished country from the Commies.<p>The
    bottom picture is some sidewalk shops in the less affluent area of the city.</td>

    <td width="86%" valign="top" height="89">This was one of the hospital ships docked in
    Saigon.&nbsp; Although inland, Saigon was a major port.&nbsp; If I could remember the name
    of the ship, those of you who remember the C.A.R.E. commercials of the '60's would recall
    the name (On July 2, Rep. Sid Bondourant saw this picture and told me the name was
    &quot;Sanctuary&quot;.&nbsp; Sid, from Grenada was a navy doctor and flew in rescue
    helicopters off the coast of North Vietnam rescuing downed pilots)..&nbsp; When I was in
    the field about 30-45 miles south of Saigon, the city would come under frequent attack and
    no supplies would get out to us.&nbsp; Heck the rear echelon people would hole up in their
    hotels and bars.&nbsp; We would take our jeeps and 3/4 tons complete with machine gun
    turrets and M-79 grenade launchers speeding down to the docks to &quot;requisition&quot;
    what we needed right off the ships.&nbsp; <p>&nbsp;</td>

    <td width="86%" valign="top" height="19">This is a little blurry as we were traveling in a
    jeep.&nbsp; This is a Catholic School in Saigon.&nbsp; Much of the city was Catholic as
    most of the Catholics fled the north after the partition.&nbsp; A large part of the
    outlying areas were Buddists.&nbsp; As you might imagine, also, the schools were formed by
    French clergy.&nbsp; Vietnam was a French colony until 1954 and the fall of Dien bien phu
    and I know a spelled that incorrectly.&nbsp; On a number of our patrols, we ran across
    French speaking rubber plantation owners.&nbsp; They were pretty much left alone as they
    paid tribute to the Viet Cong and we had little need to bother them.&nbsp; I did set up a
    headquarters in one of the rubber plantation villas late one night....Okay, we (well I
    since I was reading the map) were lost in the jungle and came up on it.&nbsp; We got some
    sleep that night.<p>&nbsp;</td>

    the &quot;decadence of society&quot;.&nbsp; The whole area around the palace was attacked
