<p>My parents are buried in the Arlington National Cemetery.&nbsp; My Father was a Command
Sergeant Major and my Mother a Sergeant. When kids (not knowing my Mother was a veteran)
&nbsp; taunted in school they would say, &quot;Your Mother wears combat boots,&quot;
expecting to pick a fight.&nbsp; I would simply say, &quot;You knew my Mother?&quot;</p>

<p>Here I am with my brothers and sisters.&nbsp; Next to me is Maureen (we call her
Mickey).&nbsp; She was a Military Police Woman, one of the first in the Army who was not a
WAC.&nbsp; She married a soldier.&nbsp; Her daughter (my niece) went the route my brother
and I did attending OCS and becoming an officer.&nbsp; When the interviewers saw the
letters sent by my brother and I and her family's military background, they asked her
&quot;Why the army?&quot;&nbsp; Duh.&nbsp; Her husband recently returned from Iraq where
his tank unit led the assault on Fallujah.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Next to her is Michael.. Mike is a retired Major General.&nbsp; He commanded the
largest Army Reserve Command in the United States.&nbsp; Mike and I served in the same
unit in Vietnam, although he was an Infantry Platoon leader.&nbsp; On his first tour, Mike
was shot and severely wounded.&nbsp; About 2 a.m., our Battalion Executive Officer came
and got me to let me know he was involved in an ambush.&nbsp; Mike and I talked on the
radio for a short while and then he was hit in the chest, collapsing his lung, and the
arm.&nbsp; Medivaced to a M.A.S.H unit, he was laid up for a while before being sent to a
VA hospital near Valley Forge to recover. While he was at the M.A.S.H unit, I visited him.
&nbsp; He had the prettiest nurse taking care of him.&nbsp; She was a Georgia peach for
sure.&nbsp; He has no recollection of her....too bad.&nbsp; Mike has two Legion of Merits,
the highest award for Service or Achievement in the Army, a Bronze Star,
Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry, two Purple Hearts. He had 38 years of service.</p>

<p>Next is Robert.&nbsp; As of this day (July 1, 2005) Robert is on his second tour of
duty for the Iraq war.&nbsp; He is stationed in Washington where he works in investigative
services and does a lot of Homeland Security work.&nbsp; He is a Warrant Officer 4, a rank
that is not enlisted and not an officer but denotes a highly specialized skill in the
service.&nbsp; Robert has several Army Commendation Medals and more than 30 years of
service.</p>

<p>Next is Patrick.&nbsp; Pat also recently retired with over 30 years of service. &nbsp;
He was a Master Sergeant.&nbsp; Pat initially joined the Air Force (a pansy) as an Air
Policeman (I believe that is what they call it).&nbsp; He got smart and transferred to the
Army when his time with the boys in blue was up.&nbsp; Pat currently travels the world
teaching foreign air traffic controllers how to perform their jobs better.&nbsp; He has
developed software and Internet sites for use by the FAA and international air traffic
controllers.</p>

<p>Our youngest sister is Martha.&nbsp; Martha wrote us all letters.&nbsp; </p>

<p>My goal:&nbsp; Among a few others, I want to be the oldest living Vietnam Veteran left,
or at least make it to 100.&nbsp; I want to be interviewed one day and I want to
say,
&quot;do not trust a politician who rattles the sword for war; do not allow the politician
to take the country to war without a clamor from the overwhelming majority of Americans
for war; do not go to war unless a draft is in place first (without one, there is no stake
for a personal loss in the fight); and go to war only when the entire nation is willing to
sacrifice the comforts we enjoy in peace.</p>

<p>I want my grandchildren to not have to make the choice I had to make at 18.</p>

<p>I want to be interred in Arlington in the same vault at the <span class="bodyLink2">Columbarium</span>
where my parent's remains are.</p>
