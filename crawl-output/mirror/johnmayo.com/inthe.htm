    left our base camp at Bear Cat to go to Long Binh or coming back, we had to wait at a
    gathering point to build up enough vehicles for a convoy.&nbsp; The Military Police would
    then escort us &quot;hell bent for leather&quot; 15 kilometers or so over an
    &quot;unsecured&quot; hardtop road that looked much like one of our potholed country back
    roads that county supervisors have forgotten.&nbsp; It was one one of these trips about my
    6-7th day in country that I was first shot at.&nbsp; Oh, what a feeling.&nbsp; At the
    rallying points, scores of children would be selling anything from silk to sodas to beer
    and yes, unfortunately their sisters.&nbsp; This girl sold Cokes.&nbsp; I bought them from
    her, but never drank any (sounds like Bill Clinton).&nbsp; Don't drink the water or sodas,
    but beer was OK as long as it had disease killing alcohol in it. There were so many
    children. &nbsp; Too many alone on their own.</td>

    <td width="86%" valign="top" height="133">Now, here's a sight you won't see in the
    States.&nbsp; This is a farmer preparing his rice field with water buffalo or oxen.&nbsp;
    When we first moved into the Delta, we were in the dry season.&nbsp; We set up our initial
    bivouac area in the rice paddies.&nbsp; We were able to stay in those positions for about
    six weeks or so until we moved villagers out of their own village and we took over their
    &quot;pads&quot; of higher ground areas on which we placed our squad size tents.&nbsp; We
    gave farm implement equipment to the rice growers and there was a huge effort to teach
    them how to scientifically raise rice.&nbsp; In fact some kind of &quot;miracle&quot; rice
    was introduced by the Peace Corps and others interests from U.S. universities which made
    Vietnam a leading exporter of rice.&nbsp; The Mekong Delta was important to the Viet Cong
    because it was the &quot;breadbasket&quot; of the country. <p>&nbsp;</td>

    and if they were not dusty, muddy ones.&nbsp; We wore goggles when traveling and when we
    got to where we were going, everyone had the same color face...dust.&nbsp; <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The bottom picture is a home in a rice field.&nbsp; If you liked coconuts, there was an
    exhaustible supply of them and bananas.&nbsp; You know what we call &quot;elephant&quot;
    grass or leaves around our homes was everywhere in Vietnam. &nbsp; When I came home and
    met Dianne's (my first wife) parents in Shelby, MS, her Father took me out to see his
    crops.&nbsp; When we came to the rice fields, I thought I was having a flash back.&nbsp;
    There is a smell about rice paddies you never get out of you. &nbsp; And for the most
    part, they all look alike.&nbsp; I will say, our Delta rice paddy mosquitoes would take on
    any I saw in Vietnam.</p>

    carrying rock to build or repair a road.&nbsp; Not that the men were off to war, I was
    told that the way they did it was that the women worked and the men either
    &quot;thought&quot; or drove the heavy equipment.</td>

    on paths.&nbsp; Tires might be punctured and when we stopped to change tires we might be
    ambushed. We were some really fast tire changers.&nbsp; On the path this is something that
    might go through a boot.&nbsp; The points would often have dung on them to cause further
    disease.&nbsp; </td>

    paddy.&nbsp; I believe it was a rice paddy.&nbsp; The line in the upper part of the water
    is actually a hundred or more ducks crossing the road to the right and going through the
    water.&nbsp; Moats were common beside many homes in country villages or out in the
    country.&nbsp; The residents raised fish in them.&nbsp; Some were this large and others
    were no more than 15-20 feet wide and the length of the side of the hooch.&nbsp; </td>

    trees on a plantation. As you know rubber was a very important product prior to WW II.
    &nbsp; The Japanese coveted the rubber producing countries of Southeast Asia.&nbsp; Trees
    are tapped much like maple trees are tapped to get sap for syrup.&nbsp; The sap from
    rubber trees is gathered in tanks and brought to a central location on the plantation for
    processing.</td>

    rivers were tidal and that took some getting use to.</td>
