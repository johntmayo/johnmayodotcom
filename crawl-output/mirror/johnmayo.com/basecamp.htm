    This is what a base camp looked like early on.&nbsp; I am somewhat amused by what I hear
    of living conditions in Iraq.&nbsp; The first three days in country we filled
    sandbags.&nbsp; We complained, complained, complained.&nbsp; We enlarged the camp by day
    by clearing jungle, and filled sandbags in the evening.&nbsp; The fourth night we were
    mortared....we didn't complain anymore, and the bags seemed to fill faster.<p>&nbsp;</td>

    tent and jumped in during the attack.&nbsp; The trenches would have half culverts over
    them also sandbagged.&nbsp; But, we got there in October, the monsoon season. &nbsp; Our
    &quot;protection&quot; remained a lap pool for much of the three months I was in basecamp.<p>&nbsp;</td>

    staff people to handle the supply or personnel matters of our division.&nbsp; Tony became
    an assistant S-4 (supply) officer and I an assistant S-1 (personnel officer, picture of
    sign on bottom).&nbsp; I was never so unhappy with an assignment in my life. I wanted back
    on the line with my troops and was never more grateful when it happened a month
    later.&nbsp; <p>&nbsp;</td>

    Division Headquarters was here, the major maintenance and supply facilties, the medical
    center, and the replacement company where &quot;cherries&quot; from the states became
    acclimated to the country.&nbsp; My last position in Vietnam was training replacements and
    taking them out on their first combat mission.&nbsp; Those made for some hairy moments.
    &nbsp; You tell these guys after forming your perimeter to stay low and be quiet.&nbsp; I
    forgot to tell them not to let anything into our position.&nbsp; I imagine my surprise
    when a local on his two wheeled, waterbuffalo drawn cart walked right into my CP at 2
    a.m.!&nbsp; Here is a shot of our company motor pool and the other is a &quot;cherry&quot;
    walking through the dust.&nbsp; If it was not muddy, it was dusty.&nbsp; I was in base
    camp for three months.&nbsp; After that we headed to the rice paddies of the Mekong Delta.

    <td width="85%" valign="top">After we blew up or bulldozed a lot of jungle, we started
    building the basecamp.&nbsp; We built roads, mess halls (cafeterias you might call them),
    headquarters buildings, latrines, latrines, and more latrines, and a few showers. &nbsp;
    Nothing was built with solid sides.&nbsp; We more or less, put up 2 x 4 or 6 studs,
    covered them with screens, and then nailed on 1 x 6 boards that were nailed louvered so
    there was open air.&nbsp; <p>In the center picture, the young man is a Spec 4 McAtee. This
    picture was taken the first month in country.&nbsp;&nbsp; By the end of the year this 18
    year old would become the most decorated man in our Battalion.&nbsp; He was on a mine
    sweeping detail when his sweeper tripped a grenade boobytrap.&nbsp; He jumped on the
    grenade, but it failed to go off.&nbsp; I put him in for a Medal of Honor, but he received
    a Distinquished Service Cross instead, the nation's second highest award for Heroism.
    &nbsp; He had also received a Bronze Star.</p>
    <p>The bottom picture is one of latrines and showers.&nbsp; I was also grateful to finally
    leave the basecamp in December and begin operating with the 2nd of the 60th Infantry
    Battalion, 9th Infantry Division in the Mekong Delta.</td>

    all day clearing jungle and providing perimeter security at night, few of us were really
    in any mood to spend our free time filling sandbags even if we were getting mortared.
    &nbsp; We found it more efficient to hire locals to do some of this labor work for us.
    &nbsp; Needless to say, the local economies boomed wherever a basecamp located and there
    were major bases all over Vietnam.&nbsp; We took a basecamp a couple hundred yards square
    and turned it into a two mile square&nbsp; basecamp for nearly 20,000 American Soldiers.</td>

    see NFL football games on Armed Forces TV network, a week after they were played.<p>I
    recall writing a letter-to-the-editor of the Clarion Ledger in 1968.&nbsp;&nbsp; I still
    have the letter and read it.&nbsp; I am amazed of how it follows word-for-word what our
    men and women are writing today from Iraq to their papers back home.&nbsp; I learned
    valuable lessons after coming back home about politics and war and the American People.
    &nbsp; Only time will judge our failure or success in Iraq.&nbsp; But, I can tell you, the
    politicians have learned little from our experiences in Vietnam. </td>
