<p>I am pasting here an email I sent to my list.&nbsp; Our visit to the
Consulate Grounds was almost a spiritual one.&nbsp; I am not one for &quot;God
and Country&quot; rhetoric.&nbsp; I just do not believe the United States is
&quot;the chosen one&quot;.&nbsp; But, having said that, I came away from this
experience humbled by the greatness of our country, awed by the people who want
to get here, and thankful that through an accident of birth, I am grateful and
proud to be a citizen of the United States of America.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This page has three sections:&nbsp;</p>
<p>the first are my thoughts on the Consulate grounds located on the former U.S.
Embassy property,;</p>
<p>The second is of the flag as it flew from the original flag pole; and&nbsp;</p>
<p> the third is &quot;The Roof&quot; from which the last Americans were
evacuated in 1975.</p>

      You could feel the sense of standing on sacred ground.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>From one spot, I took pictures of two bangor trees which remain the
      last in country witnesses on the grounds to see the Viet Cong breech the
      wall and be fended off by Army Military Police, United States Marines,
      American civilians and their Vietnamese counterparts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

      </span>I even took pictures of the ground where I was standing.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">There are

      </span>The U.S. plaque was also outside on the wall but circumstances
      caused it to be moved inside.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I
      was on the outskirts of the city during Tet as Americans provided the ring
      of security for the Capitol City.</font></p>

    <td width="50%">If you were like me, you might have been under the
      impression that the famous picture of the helicopter landing on the
      rooftop was at the embassy in 1975.
      <p>Actually, the rooftop is about one fourth mile away.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText"><o:p>
      From around the corner of the consulate, we could see the top of a
      building which has become the icon for the fall of Saigon--the top of a
      nondescript 5 or six story narrow building in line with other similar, but
      one or two story shorter buildings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
      was the HQ of the CIA in Vietnam.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
      is where the picture of the last helicopter so many of us see is located.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">We walked a block, went into the Diamond Exchange
      Department Store, walked up to the fourth floor, entered a Kentucky Fried
      Chicken restaurant and took the top picture in this series.&nbsp; On the
      left is the Post Office, on the right is the Cathedral.&nbsp; You can
      barely make out &quot;The Roof&quot;&nbsp; The tall building behind it is
      the Caravelle and the most likely place the picture was taken from.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">The Consulate is on the same street, one block
      away from the Department Store.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">In my pictures you will see the top of a building
      with what looks like a utility room on it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>From the roof of that shed, US helicopters carried off the last of
      the Americans from the Embassy about a quarter mile away.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Later in the day I attempted to go to the top of the building.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>I had the desk clerk write a note for me, &quot;I would like to go
      to the top of the building, please.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>I was stopped.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">I really do not think the people I talked to knew
      the significance of the roof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
      bottom of the building has a beauty salon--nice interior in the store for
      a gray drab building.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
      ladies there were clueless.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So,
      I went next door where a private security firm said I could not go
      upstairs where there were just several levels of apartments.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">The bottom picture is taken from the street which
      is actually the front of the building.&nbsp; Higher up and probably a
      couple blocks away at the Caravelle Hotel is where the famous picture was
      probably taken.</p>
