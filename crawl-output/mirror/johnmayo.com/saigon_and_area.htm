<p>Saigon was the name of the city when I was &quot;in country&quot; from
October of&nbsp; '66-May of '68.&nbsp; The capital of South Vietnam from
partitioning in 1954, I believe to 1975 when the South Vietnamese government
surrendered and the North Vietnamese reunified the country.</p>
<p>In 1968, the population was 2.5 million and today, Ho Chi Minh City is a
sprawling city of 8.5 million.&nbsp; </p>

      <p>Several nights we kicked back for a beer or two.&nbsp; You can imagine
      how the French during their colonial days looked down upon the Vietnamese
      both literally and figuratively.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>From this site, U.S. Army officers, Senior NCO's and diplomats staying
      here during the war would have seen &quot;The Continental Hotel&quot;
      (another place U.S personnel stayed) bombed at breakfast time at the very
      beginning of the war. </p>
      <p>A short distance from here was the famous &quot;rooftop&quot; where
      hotel guests would have seen the last Americans leaving Vietnam in 1975.</p>
      <p>Note the flag.&nbsp; Like the U.S. flags are flown from government
      buildings, businesses, hotels, and the like.&nbsp; seeing them during the
      day was not a bother, but after a while, watching them at night from the
      roof got to be painful.</td>

      <p>Our guide told us 8.5 million people live in Ho Chi Minh City and there
      are 4 million motorbikes or scooters.&nbsp; No Harleys. </p>
      <p>As you can see the preferred mode of transportation is the motor
      scooters.&nbsp; A family of five fits on one, we saw it.&nbsp; Our guide
      took us to the airport on the last day.&nbsp; His wife was there to meet
      him to take him home on their scooter--she was carrying her 14 month old
      in a seat on the gas tank and scooted back so her husband could
      drive.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>We saw a man with five dogs on one, three behind him (in a three side
      cage, no back), on across the tank, one on his lap--going to obedience
      school.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>Drivers carry live pigs on these, washer machines, window panes. we
      witnessed all of them.</p>
      <p>There is public transportation, but it is not used because people
      prefer their own ride.&nbsp; When I was there, the three wheeled Lambretta
      with driver and a covered rear that could transport 6 people comfortably
      but usually packed them in like sardines was popular--can't see any
      today.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>December, '07 helmets became mandatory.&nbsp; You see scooter sales
      shops and helmet shops all over the city and country.</td>

      <p>When we arrived on a Tuesday night at 11:00 p.m. (I believe it was
      Tuesday), a fairly good gathering of people were at the doors and in the
      garden area praying.&nbsp; Nothing organized, just praying.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>The two main religions are Buddhists and Catholicism.&nbsp; Pagodas and
      churches abound. On Sunday we passed a Catholic Church at the end of Mass
      in the country.&nbsp; The men were wearing coats and ties.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>This may be a Communist Country, but we learned that religion is openly
      practiced. </p>
      <p>Note, the glass building behind the Cathedral.&nbsp; This is the
      Diamond Plaza, a high rise department store and office building.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>The Department store rivals anything Neiman-Marcus or Macy's might put
      up.&nbsp; Very modern, full of western products, and like the name brand
      upscale department stores in the U.S., jewelry and cosmetics are on the
      first floor.&nbsp; Toys have a floor to themselves as does software,
      appliances, and &quot;entertainment&quot; like arcades.</td>
