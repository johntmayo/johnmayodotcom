<p>I am posting here a copy of the email I sent out the night we discovered our
primary destination that morning.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Discovered base camp</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>
&nbsp;Sunday Night 9:33 p.m.---9:33 a.m. Mississippi time</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><o:p>
I cannot begin to describe to you the morning.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>We were coming back from Can Tho, our guide said he and the driver now
knew the way to Tan Tru.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>3 hours
later we were asking for directions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Look,
I knew how to get there.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We went
over and stopped at two places with bridges.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>I had indeed built a bridge at both places which were eventually replaced
by concrete bridges.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then an old man
said he knew of a bridge that Americans built that was still there.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><o:p>
Now as you view these pictures, any hardtop roads you see were dirt when I was
there...we called the material laterite or as some of us Southerners noted,
&quot;The red clay of Georgia&quot;.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>You
will see just how wide/narrow the road was in the dirt road scene.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Those roads have not changed.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">In this group of pictures, you will see me with a group
to townspeople.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>THEY WERE CHILDREN
WHEN I BUILT THE BRIDGE!<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I had my
original pictures and they began yelling for friends and pointing themselves out
in the pictures.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They all remembered
us doing the bridge.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When I get hole
and post the pictures on my website, you will see &quot;then&quot; and
&quot;Now&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The 287 foot bridge
is now concrete, mine was timber.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">This bridge forever changed my life, gave me direction,
a goal.&nbsp; Revisiting it has had a tremendous impact me today at 61.&nbsp; I
wish I could describe the feeling so that you would understand just how I felt
when these people mobbed, hugged, kissed, held my hand.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><o:p>
You will also see a river.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is a
major tributary of the Mekong.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>From
here we launched our large rafts to carry APC's or the small ones to carry
infantry.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>You will see a picture
with a van on the road.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This was a
large dirt, just plain dirt path.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We
landed our helicopters here to load up and start an assault on a position.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><o:p>
You will also see a modern two story school following those river pictures.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This is a community college.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
is built on our base camp and the first one is exactly where my platoon's
positions were.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We eventually took
matters into our own hands because every time a Chinook landed, it would lift
our ten man (GP MEDIUM TENTS) out of their stakes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>We traveled to where Mac Huddleston was stationed and stole corrugated
tin roofing from the supply point for our roof and got rid of the tents.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><o:p>
Unfortunately we were ordered by the battalion commander who saw the contraband
to steal some more and pass it out---we did---we were good at what we did.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><o:p>
You will see a tall memorial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
is dedicated to the VC who died in the area.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This spot was where we held our POW's for transfer.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Keep in mind, whatever you see was all rice paddies and
dirt roads...all of it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This was a
hamlet of maybe a few hundred people, now it is a town with a modern school for
the surrounding students.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><img border="0" src="tran_and_me_at_bridge.jpg" width="315" height="236">
I hit the ceiling when we came to this American Bailey Bridge.&nbsp; Made of
structural aluminum, a squad can put on together like tinker toys in no
time.&nbsp; No nuts and bolts all pinned together and clamps.&nbsp; With me is
Tran &quot;Tony&quot; Traun, our guide and someone who was excited as I
was.&nbsp; My brother was shot in the area of this bridge in '67.&nbsp; I was
talking with him on the radio about 2 a.m. in the morning.&nbsp; His platoon and
a V.C. unit saw and open fired on each other about the same time.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><img border="0" src="bailey_bridge_long_view.jpg" width="318" height="238">
Depending on the length of the bridge, you can add eight foot panels to
strengthen the bridge.&nbsp; For example, this is a double, double with two
panels side-by-side and two high.&nbsp; The largest you can go is a triple,
triple.</p>

      river to land them on the banks.&nbsp; We were ambushed twice while
      operating these.&nbsp; Grenades exploded on the decks, bullets went

haunted by little from the war.&nbsp; But, one thing I do think about are all
these graves scattered throughout rice paddies.&nbsp; We swept the road this was
taken from for mines every morning.&nbsp; The road was dirt.&nbsp; One morning,
two of my men were injured by a command detonated mine.&nbsp; I called in a
dustoff, it came quickly.&nbsp; We had one man on and were loading the second on
a stretcher.&nbsp; We started taking in heavy small arms fire when the chopper unrepentantly
lifted off, dropping my soldier to the ground.&nbsp; I was upset to say the
least with the chopper pilot who I thought was a coward.&nbsp; He told me he's
come back when we suppressed the ambush.&nbsp; I called in for artillery to take
out the V.C.&nbsp; The arty would not fire because a village was behind the tree
line.&nbsp; We were all hunkered down behind our vehicles as we were still
drawing fire.&nbsp; I had a two recoilless rifles each mounted on a jeep.&nbsp;
We loaded them and fired on the graves because the V.C. were behind them.&nbsp;
To say the least we took two of them out.&nbsp; And got the enemy.&nbsp; While I
had to do that, I regret it to this day.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="mom_with_baby.jpg" width="396" height="528"> Everywhere
we went Mothers wanted to show us their babies and children.</p>

begin to tell you what this scene did for me.&nbsp; Please, read the <a href="final__thoughts.htm"> &quot;Final
Thoughts chapter.</a>&nbsp; When folks saw my 40 year old pictures, they hugged,
kissed, and wanted to hold my hands.&nbsp; People are the same no matter where
you go.&nbsp; they want peace, what's best for their families.&nbsp; They want
to laugh, worship how they choose.&nbsp; We're all so much alike that war is
insane.&nbsp; This was a very moving and spiritual time for me.&nbsp; The
American Soldier got it right!&nbsp; We did win the &quot;Hearts and Minds of
the People&quot;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="DSC00523.JPG" width="320" height="240"> And, here is the last picture I took at
&quot;The Bridge&quot;.&nbsp; These are the children and grandchildren of the
folks above.&nbsp; I was trying to take a picture of the bank on the other side
when they jumped into the picture. Thank God for the American Soldier.</p>
