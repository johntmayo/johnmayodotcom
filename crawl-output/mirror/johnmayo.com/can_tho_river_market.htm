<p>I have to tell you, this was the tourist highlight of the trip.&nbsp; Going
on a boat ride on the Can Though River to a river market that had a tradition of
hundreds of years.&nbsp; We told the guide this was a day that made the trip
into the Delta.&nbsp; The sights, smells, food were everything one could want as
a tourist. There will be a lot of pictures here.&nbsp; I had a hard time
eliminating them.&nbsp; I wish this site had smell-o-vision and sounds.&nbsp;
What a wonderful experience for the senses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="tour_boat.JPG" width="320" height="240"> This was our tour boat.&nbsp; Three
visitors, our guide, and the driver's family</p>
<p><img border="0" src="boat_driver.JPG" width="240" height="320"> This is our driver.&nbsp; He spoke
very good English and what he did not understand, he asked us questions as to
what a word meant.&nbsp; He was very nice and pointed out a lot of sites.&nbsp;
Everyone went out of their way to please, help, and inform us.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="driver_with_cell_phone.JPG" width="320" height="240"> I took this picture because
the driver got a phone call and was hesitant to answer it.&nbsp; I told him to
go ahead and take or make any call.&nbsp; EVERYONE seems to have a cell phone
and many are on the internet.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="boat_family.JPG" width="320" height="240"> Our driver and his family. Towards the
end of the boat ride, the wife brings out her boxes of robes and dresses and
begins showing them to us.&nbsp; I didn't want to buy anything, but she was so
good at it and very nice, I got a silk robe for Agnes, than I had to get
something for the girls so--a traditional dress for Jennifer, Rebecca, Margaret,
Emily, Betsy, Grace, Angela.&nbsp; I had gotten our only grand daughter a
traditional ao dai outfit--pants and the top is a sort of long blouse with the
shirt and what would be split at the side of the legs and flowing cover for the
pants from waist to ankles.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="son.JPG" width="240" height="320"> Look, children everywhere are just a
like.&nbsp; This boy was precocious, showed out, and he let you know he was
smart.&nbsp; He recited his ABC's and counted to ten--in English for us.&nbsp;
His parents were very, very proud of him.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="tran_and_boat_driver.JPG" width="320" height="240"> Our Guide Tran
&quot;Tony&quot; Thaun</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="medriving_boat.JPG" width="320" height="240"> Danger, danger on the high
seas...Me at the wheel.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="market_1.JPG" width="320" height="240"> The start of the market which goes on for
a solidly packed half mile or so.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="market_2.JPG" width="320" height="240"> This is a drink vendor.&nbsp; Note the
driver piloting with his feet.&nbsp; This is a common practice.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="market_4.JPG" width="320" height="240"></p>
<p><img border="0" src="market_6.JPG" width="320" height="240"> Boats of every description are in the
market, but you can tell what they sell by the fruit or vegetable on the mast
from the boat.&nbsp; Name the fruit or vegetable or other dry good and you'll
find it in the market.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="market_7.JPG" width="320" height="240"></p>
<p><img border="0" src="market_15.JPG" width="320" height="240"> I was just enthralled by the
scenery&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="market_12.JPG" width="320" height="240"></p>
<p><img border="0" src="market_16.JPG" width="320" height="240"> Here we see a retailer for one of the
land markets buying from his &quot;wholesaler&quot;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="market_16_2.JPG" width="320" height="240"> That's a boat with sweet potatoes, I
believe</p>
<p><img border="0" src="market_good_one.JPG" width="320" height="240"> Organized chaos</p>
<p><img border="0" src="market_tourists.JPG" width="320" height="240"> These folks were from Australia
and jumped on one of the pineapple seller's boat.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="market_pineapple.JPG" width="240" height="320"> Our driver's wife peeled a
pineapple, than cut swirls in it like a soft ice cream cone and then sliced it
down the middle from top to bottom of stalk.&nbsp; We ate then like a Popsicle</p>
<p><img border="0" src="market_me.JPG" width="320" height="240"><img border="0" src="market_me_2.JPG" width="320" height="240"><img border="0" src="market_me_3.JPG" width="320" height="240"></p>
<p>Okay.&nbsp; I took a regular picture with the market in the background.&nbsp;
Then, my smart _ _ _ brother says, &quot;Why don't you give a politician's
pose?&quot;&nbsp; So in the middle picture I am asking for a vote promising two
motor scooters for every family and in the third one, I am exhorting the
population to increase sales taxes.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="market_from_high_2.JPG" width="320" height="240"><img border="0" src="market_from_high.JPG" width="320" height="240">
The Market.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="market_drink_vendor.JPG" width="320" height="240"> Here comes a drink vendor with
soft drinks, bottled water, and beer.&nbsp; Guess which one we bought.&nbsp; It
was a hot day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="snake_and_monkey.JPG" width="320" height="240"> We stopped at a private zoo,
similar to our roadside &quot;See the amazing alligator wrestle a mere
mortal&quot;&nbsp; I really did not like this part as I do not like seeing
animals penned or chained like this.&nbsp; BUT, I could not resist taking a
picture of this snake coming out of its cage almost on cue as we passed to
menace the caged monkey.</p>
