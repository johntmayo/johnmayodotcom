<p>On this page are random pictures that I did not use.&nbsp; For me, they are part of
what I think about nearly everyday and a part of what I have become.&nbsp; I went to
Vietnam as a 19 year old second lieutenant gung ho to fight for God and Country.&nbsp;
Towards the end of my 18 month tour, I had mixed emotions about what I was going to do
with the rest of my life.&nbsp; I joined the army right after high school and became an
officer.&nbsp; To remain one, I had to get a college degree and so that was in the mix.</p>

<p>But, in April of 1968 after getting my orders to return home in May, I spent a lot of
time contemplating what I would become.&nbsp; I had settled on a life as a priest or a
politician.&nbsp; Both are somewhat alike.&nbsp; I was beginning to have mixed feelings
about Vietnam and our country going to war at all, especially a war that was essentially
an internal conflict between competing power bases.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Today is July 1 as I write this.&nbsp; There were a lot of prophetic things I wanted to
say to end here.&nbsp; But, after working nearly two weeks on this I am about worn out
emotionally from looking at the slides.&nbsp; Suffice it to say that I was changed by
Vietnam.</p>

    South Vietnamese position near us and blew up a lot of the outpost.</td>

    &nbsp; I am holding my weapon.&nbsp;Our mainstay individual weapon was the M-16.
    &nbsp; However, if you captured a Russian made AK-47, you would probably carry that with
    you as it was an excellent rifle.&nbsp; This gives you a good idea of our tent area.

 This picture was taken the month I came home, May, 1968.&nbsp; My Father, who was a WW II
combat vet, told me in no uncertain terms that a Coke was still going to cost me a dime
(that was 1968).&nbsp; And, then he put me to work painting the house as if I had never
gone.&nbsp; That was a humbling experience.&nbsp; My Father is on the ladder working, my
brother Robert is in the foreground fooling around and Pat has his hands on his hips
watching and wondering how the work is getting done...nothing has changed in nearly 40
years.
