<p>On this page are a few pictures I had not used, but I found interesting.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="USA_truck.JPG" width="320" height="240"> Lowboys (here), jeeps, trucks, tow trucks,
front-end loaders.&nbsp; All U.S. with original paint in most cases.&nbsp; They
were &quot;captured&quot; actually surrendered probably by the ARVN and are in
great shape.&nbsp; There were not thousands, but they were everywhere and
readily recognizable.&nbsp; GMC did a really good job, after all, building
there.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="supper_fish_catch.JPG" width="320" height="240"> Food presentation is everything
at a restaurant.&nbsp; Note the cucumber character snagged the sea bass.&nbsp;
We ate the fish..and the cucumber.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="DSCF1051.jpg" width="358" height="271"> My rice, and my
brother ate the decorative butterfly.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="dinner_soup_bowl.JPG" width="320" height="240"> Here's an innocent looking melon.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="dinner_soup_open.JPG" width="320" height="240"> Open it up and you have shrimp
soup.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="VC_memorial_with_ARVN.jpg" width="363" height="274"> Our
guide took us to this site where he said a V.C. attacking force took out 123
ARVN troops and 3 U.S. advisors in 1963.&nbsp; This is the battle site.&nbsp;
The bomb marks the spot a U.S. plan dropped one.&nbsp; Close by is a memorial to
the &quot;victors&quot;.&nbsp; This battle had other implications.&nbsp; The
U.S. advisors requested, pleaded with the local colonel to send reinforcement
and that request went up to Saigon and ARVN headquarters.&nbsp; Help was
denied.&nbsp; This ARVN loss was the turning point for the U.S. as the Defense
Department and the American Public decided to &quot;Americanize&quot; the
war.&nbsp; it would remain that way until January, 1968 and the Tet offensive in
which we had a decisive victory country end, but the massive VC attack signaled
the beginning of the end.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="waitresses.JPG" width="320" height="240">  I should print all of my &quot;Flat
Coleman&quot; pictures.&nbsp; Coleman, my grandson, the night before I left
wanted me to take his hand drawn version of &quot;Flat Stanley&quot; to
Vietnam.&nbsp; Margaret, our daughter, e mailed it to me.&nbsp; Starting at the
Atlanta airport, and in Korea and Vietnam I had people sign it.&nbsp; People
from Switzerland, Singapore, China, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Hong Cong,
Korea, Australia, the USA, and points all over Vietnam signed on and I got
pictures of most.&nbsp; Coleman made me famous and I was grateful.&nbsp; I met a
lot of really good looking women who thought I was a really neat grandfather...awh,
yes, but to have been 40 years younger....
