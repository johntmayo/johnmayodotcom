how it was 40 years ago.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By the time

job of a combat engineer is to support the infantry in accomplishing its
mission.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We advised senior
commanders are likely routes of attack, escape, river landings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>If the cavalry needed a bridge to cross a river with their Armored
Personnel Carriers, we built it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If
the infantry needed to assault a river bank or beach, we had the assault rafts.
If something needed to be blown up to deny the enemy access or get it out of the
way, we blew it up.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We also built
playgrounds in hamlets, repaired schools, helped the hamlet next to us any way
we could.<o:p>

line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Each
line squad was divided into two sections headed by the sergeants (squad leader
and assistant) and included a truck driver and assistant driver, carpenter and
demolition specialists <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">The
HQ squad had the platoon leader and sergeant, radio-telephone operator, front
end loader operator, dozer operator, medic.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">When
we organized as infantry, we had the same configuration as an infantry platoon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In the line squads, the truck drivers and assistants became the machine
gunners and assistants (loader and ammo humper).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Besides the machine gun they carried .45 caliber pistols and the
assistant had a “thumper” M-79 grenade launcher.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The others were rifleman carrying M-16’s.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">The
headquarters platoon truck drivers became machine gunners, the front end loader
and dozer operators became mortar men and the rest of us had M-16’s.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>We all carried what we called “the basic load” of appropriate
ammunition, grenades, smoke grenades.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
RTO who was also my jeep driver became my radioman.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">We
did everything from building outhouses in the permanent division base camp to
blowing up bunkers, trees, anything else that got in our way when out in the
boonies (http://www.johnmayo.com/blowing_up_safe.jpg).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">The
15<sup>th</sup> Combat Engineer Battalion left Ft. Riley Kansas under cover of
darkness and in “secret” shortly after midnight in early October, 1966.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>We flew to Oakland, CA from Kansas City, and than ship to Vietnam. We
went to Bear Cat, Vietnam where we began building the 9<sup>th</sup> Infantry
permanent base camp.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Division
came over in December of that year.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">In
late February, 1967, my company moved out of Bear Cat, through Saigon, and down
Highway 1A to Tan An where we began building the 3<sup>rd</sup> Brigade of the 9<sup>th</sup>
Inf Div basecamp.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Newly elected
Representative Mac Huddleston and I were talking one day and during our
conversation of experiences in Vietnam, we discovered that he provided my air
cover as our convoy moved south of Saigon—small world.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">You
can Google “Bear Cat” and follow Hwy 51 to its intersection with Hwy 1A,
turn left, go through Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon), and continue on 1A to Tan An.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Google will pin Bear Cat, but if you look just to the south, you’ll see
an airstrip.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We landed on that strip
which was dirt at the time nearly 42 years ago on our first day in country.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>We moved to the base camp and started building 9<sup>th</sup> Div home.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">From
Tan An, my platoon moved east described below to support the 2<sup>nd</sup> of
the 60<sup>th</sup> Inf BN of the 9<sup>th</sup> Inf Division and that is where
I spent most of the remainder of my tour.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">If
you have gotten this far and are interested, go to the Google Home Site.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Click on “Maps” and then enter Tan An Vietnam.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>That takes you to the Mekong Delta of Vietnam.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Tan An should be in the middle of the screen.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Just on the west side of and on the edge of town you will see what looks
to be a white tin roof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That should
be a building on the air strip, it wasn’t there 40 years ago and we built the
strip for helicopters.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Next,
there is a road that leaves the town headed north—HWY 1A.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Go north to Saigon on that road.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Turn
Right at the first intersection.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>You
will cross water---we built a bridge there-- follow the road until it
“Y’s” with another road.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Turn
left and go to the crossroads intersection.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Turn right at the crossroads intersection and go southeast.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>You will cross a large creek, small tributary.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>My platoon built a bridge there.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Keep
going straight and you come to another village.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">This
was our base camp.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">By
the way, our bridges were either timber or what we called “Bailey” bridges
which were heavy duty structural aluminum put together like tinker toys or an
erector set.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There were no bolts and
nuts…all lynch pins about eight inches long or so and three inches or so in
diameter.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">We
moved all the inhabitants from that village (not very many, but we still
displaced them to another location).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We
put our tents on their hooch pads.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
short road going right to the river we used as a helicopter strip.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>We also had our assault boats (</span><a href="http://www.johnmayo.com/preparing_river_assault.jpg"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">http://www.johnmayo.com/preparing_river_assault.jpg</span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">)
and M4T6 raft (<a href="http://www.johnmayo.com/working1.htm">http://www.johnmayo.com/working1.htm</a>)
capable of ferrying 2 APC’s up and down the river for support. The whole area
is surrounded by rice paddies, palm trees, and what we call here elephant ear
plants that were as thick as a jungle.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Take
a left at the intersection in the village and you come to a hamlet and another
wide creek/tributary.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Viet Minh
destroyed the bridge there except for concrete pilings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>11 men rebuilt that 287 foot bridge capable of supporting APC’s in
seven daylight days and defended it during three nights of attacks.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(<a href="http://www.johnmayo.com/building.htm">http://www.johnmayo.com/building.htm</a>)<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Children
in the village made mud models of our trucks dumping timber on top of the half
completed bridge.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>One of my men
cradled a pregnant woman in his arms as he lifted and walked her across of
footbridge we built before starting on the bridge.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>She delivered within a half hour after reaching the midwife’s hooch on
the other side.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The mid wife brought
the baby out for all of us to see shortly afterwards.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">From
the base camp, look directly north and very slightly to the west…very
slightly.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>You will see the lower end
of a bend or dip in a river.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>You
will also see two smaller tributaries of that river. They are roughly 1 to 1.5
kilometers apart .<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Between them is
an area we called “The Bowling Alley”, a strip bounded by the river on the
north and huge elephant ear plants and palm trees on the south with an open area
(the bowling alley) in the middle.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
company sized base camp (100-120 men, including a squad of my engineers) was
located here bounded on the north side by the major river and on the east by the
smaller tributary.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The camp was
probably no more than 300 feet wide, if that.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>One night the VC came out of the west, snuck down the “alley” and
then stormed the camp, yelling and screaming they ran through the perimeter
defenses, ran through the camp, shooting up everything, and jumped into boats,
dugouts, and what have you in the eastern river.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">No
one was killed, very light injuries, was like a bunch of drunken boys crashing a
party, doing what they could to scare the guests and leaving as fast as they
came.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The incident was all over as
quick as it began.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>

</span>Vietnam was a place where many 18-19 year olds had more responsibility,
more focus, and more sense of purpose than they would ever have the rest of
their lives.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Vietnam was a place
that found men who should have been at a frat party at 20, taking charge of
squads of men older than themselves in a desperate cause for survival.<o:p>

</span>I joined my unit as a platoon leader of the First Platoon, Charlie
Company, 15<sup>th</sup> Combat Engineers, 9<sup>th</sup> Infantry Division, in
the Army of the United States of America.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thirty-eight
men, except for the platoon sergeant and squad leaders, were new to the Army.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>We trained from June to September and left for Vietnam.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Twenty-seven days on the ocean and we finally reached Vietnam.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>We could see the beaches from the troopship “Sultana” when we were
given the order to prepare to go over the sides.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>“WHAT!?”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We had not
trained for that!<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>But, over the sides we climbed, and fell, tripped, or rolled <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>into
WW II landing craft, roaring away from the “Mother ship” and to the beaches,
battle gear strapped to our backs, weapons at the ready, and…<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>NO AMMUNITION!!!<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Talking about some scared straight kind of moment…God had our
attention.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The LST’s hit the
beach, front went down, we unloaded the craft, band started playing, girls ran
up to us and draped us in flowers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>“Welcome
to Vietnam”.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>That was the beginning day of the next 12 life changing months “in
country”.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I would sign up for
another tour when in my 11<sup>th</sup> month I got orders to go to Aberdeen
Proving Grounds to be attached to a Signal Unit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>“What,” I thought, “do they want a combat engineer in a signal unit
for?”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I traveled from our home
base in the field in the rice paddies around Ap Binh Thanh about 30 or so klicks
south of<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Saigon in the Mekong Delta,
through the Capital City, to about 30 more klicks northeast of the City to a
place called “Bear Cat”, the Division HQ of the 9<sup>th</sup> Infantry
Division.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I found the S-1 (human
resources).<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I signed up for six more months of Fun, Travel, and Adventure, the first
in my unit to do so.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>My platoon supported an infantry battalion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>We rarely saw our own company commander and for many of my men and
myself, we planned river assault landings, defenses, three-seven day missions
“ in the boonies”.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We blew up
bunkers, bridges, and enemy fortifications.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>We built bridges, roads, schoolyards, and relationships with children
that for the older guys probably were a lot like their own.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><o:p>

</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">There’s
no sense trying to explain just how all those experiences became a force for
changing stars. You had to be there. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>In
April, ’68 when I got orders to return home, I sat on the edge of my bunk and
began to think of a future.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Vietnam
limited my choices to return to the Army after getting a degree or two more
paths.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I would become a priest or
get into politics.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Obviously, the
latter and the heart of a woman won out.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">I do
not know what to anticipate tomorrow as I leave from Atlanta’s airport and a
24 hour trip to Tan Son Nhut Air Base (the same one I flew out of to return
home).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">I
will make that trip again from Bear Cat into the Delta.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>I will look for those bridges the First Platoon built.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>I will look for the schoolyard in front of a two room school house in a
village of thatched huts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I will
bring pictures of children who are now 40 years older.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>And, hopefully I will find <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>a
287 foot timber bridge set on fire by the Viet Minh in the ‘50’s and
reconstructed by 11 men in 7 days, defended each night, and where we learned
that children everywhere are all alike…curious, trusting, and showoffs
(http://www.johnmayo.com/jumping_off_bridge.jpg).<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Vietnam
for many of us is but a distant memory.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For
many of us, the experience happened last night in another hour of restless
sleep. For all of us, our future was altered by a night in a mosquito infested
rice paddy, sweat-dripping jungle, mountaintop firebase, and yes, even in those
pansy a_ _ air conditioned Air Force barracks in Thailand or those flattops and
tin cans out on the ocean.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">I
wouldn’t wish this distant memory on anyone.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>But, I wouldn’t trade a single restless night. There’s probably a lot
more to write about as I prepare for this trip.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>But, some things are best left unsaid and some stars unchanged.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">For
now, I want to experience the beauty of a country as I have never thought of it
before.<o:p>
