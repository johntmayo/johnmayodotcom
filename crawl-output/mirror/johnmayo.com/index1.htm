<p>The title of this site is from the book and movie &quot;We Were Soldiers Once...and
Young&quot;.&nbsp; The book by Lt. General Hal Moore and United Press
International Reporter Joe
Galloway.&nbsp; The movie, starring Mel Gipson, is probably the most authentic film of the
Vietnam War I have seen.</p>

<p>This site is the result of a week long trip back in time for me after viewing some
slides that are 38-53 years old.&nbsp; I bought a scanner three years ago.&nbsp; The
machine came with a device to scan slides and it was not until the second weekend of June
2005 that I learned how to use it.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Our future is determined by our past. We can change the future each minute of each day
by assessing past mistakes, failures, and successes and making choices that will change
the course of history.&nbsp; But no matter how much we might cry, fret, worry, or laugh,
we can't change our past.</p>

<p>On the ensuing pages are some of the 100's of slides I took in Vietnam.&nbsp; I have a
couple of degrees from Mississippi State.&nbsp; I got my education &quot;in country&quot;.</p>

<p>The pages are divided up into &quot;chapters&quot;, each one denoting a different
location or task.&nbsp; Just click on the hyperlinks at the top or side of&nbsp;
the pages.</p>

<p>All the pictures are &quot;thumbnails&quot;.&nbsp; To see a larger version,

    months after our parents' married ( or so they told us). I know he was born 11 months
    after me.&nbsp; I include this picture because we probably competed throughout school.
    &nbsp; He is really smart at business.&nbsp; I am...well, a master at little and a good
    Democrat.&nbsp; After High School, we enlisted together and served in Vietnam
    together.&nbsp; He was a platoon leader in the infantry battalion I supported as a platoon
    leader in the combat engineers.&nbsp; I took him on his first patrol, burned my fingers
    throwing a used smoke grenade into a river when I told him we couldn't leave smoke
    grenades on the roads since troops kick things that could be boobytrapped. His goal was to
    become a general, mine a politician.&nbsp; I reached mine first and lost it in a re
    election.&nbsp; He reached his and kept it until he retired as a Major General.&nbsp; We
    have two more brothers and two sisters, three of whom are in the army or a veteran of the
    army.<p>&nbsp;</td>

    files of wounded soldiers.&nbsp;&nbsp; They died in 1995 just months apart.&nbsp; My
    Father retired from the regular Army in the early '60's and went into the Reserves where
    he retired again as a Sergeant Major and the highest ranking enlisted man in the
    Mississippi Army Reserves.&nbsp; When my Mother was dying, she was slipping in and out of
      consciousness.&nbsp; The last person she recognized was a priest, the last food she
    consumed was the Sacred Host of Holy Communion, and the last word she said was
    &quot;Amen&quot; after taking it.&nbsp; She then &quot;slept&quot; for three days and
    died.&nbsp; God, to be so fortunate as to have such a death.<p>&nbsp;</td>

    School.&nbsp; I wanted Infantry, Armor, Artillery.&nbsp; Two weeks later the army told me
    I could go to any of them but a Combat Engineer Class was starting and I could get in
    right away.&nbsp; Right after New Year's 1966 I started.&nbsp; Mike went to Infantry OCS
    in April, I graduated in June, was assigned as a platoon leader in the 15th Combat
    Engineers, 9th Infantry in July, trained, and we shipped out in early October, arriving a
    week before my 20th birthday.<p>&nbsp;</td>

    this young man's head you will see a small protrusion from the ship.&nbsp; This is a wind
    scoop. You put one of these out to catch the wind and cool the room (there were six guys
    to a room and you could not pass).&nbsp; Anyway, for sport we threw apples and oranges out
    our port windows and tried to get them into the wind scoop and someone's room. &nbsp; Hey,
    what else can you do on a troop ship?&nbsp; <p>We would need the skills later for grenade

    ship, sailed under the Golden Gate, north of Hawaii, and landed in Naha City (top picture)
    on Okinawa after 20 some odd days at sea.&nbsp; I won't tell you what happened, but it was
    the first time I really drank some beer.&nbsp; Two or three days after that we were off
    the coast of Vietnam and were told we were &quot;going over the side&quot;.&nbsp; All I
    could say was &quot;@#*!&quot;.&nbsp; We did and with full battle gear...but no
    ammunition!&nbsp; As we approached the beach, the engines of the LST roared and strained,
    we rammed the bottom, the front went down, and we stormed out... to a band playing and
    girls rushing up to us with flowers...Were they not already doing that in the U.S. during
    protests?&nbsp; This was Vietnam.<p>&nbsp;</td>

    special forces camp.&nbsp; A sign on the roof of what can best be described as &quot;four
    posts holding up a top&quot; read.&nbsp; &quot;Welcome to Bear Cat.&nbsp; Elevation 33

    &nbsp; This was October, 1966 and our job was to enlarge the special forces camp to get
    ready for the rest of the Division which would come over&nbsp; in December.&nbsp; Until
    then, we were on our own with the &quot;sneaky petes&quot; and elements of the 173rd
    Airborne brigade.&nbsp; Both of them scared us more than the VC.</td>
