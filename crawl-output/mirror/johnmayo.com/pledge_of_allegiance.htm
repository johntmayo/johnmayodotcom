      <p><big>I did some internet research on the Pledge and this is some of the
      information I found.</big></p>
      <font size="2">
      <p></font><font size="4">Francis Bellamy (1855 - 1931), a Baptist
      minister, wrote the original Pledge in August 1892. He was a Christian
      Socialist.</p>
      <p>The Pledge was published in the September 8th issue of The Youth's
      Companion, the leading family magazine and the Reader's Digest of its day.</p>
      <p>In 1892 Francis Bellamy was also a chairman of a committee of state
      superintendents of education in the National Education Association. As its
      chairman, he prepared the program for the public schools' quadricentennial
      celebration for Columbus Day in 1892. He structured this public school
      program around a flag raising ceremony and a flag salute.</p>
      <p>In the material which he nationally circulated, he wrote, &quot;Let the
      flag float over every school-house in the land and the exercise be such as
      shall impress upon our youth the patriotic duty of citizenship.&quot; He
      also included the original 23 words of the Pledge which he had developed.&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"></font><font color="#FF0000" size="5">I pledge
      allegiance to my Flag, and (to*) the Republic for which it stands: one
      Nation indivisible, With Liberty and Justice for all.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="4">&nbsp;* 'to' added in October, 1892.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Thus it was that on Columbus Day in October 1892, the Pledge of
      Allegiance was repeated by more than 12 million public school children in
      every state in the union.</p>
      <p>He considered placing the word, 'equality,' in his Pledge, but knew
      that the state superintendents of education on his committee were against
      equality for women and African Americans.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Mr. Bellamy was asked to remove himself as a minister as his beliefs
      were considered too socialist for him to continue to serve in that
      capacity. He moved from his homestate of New York to Florida where he
      discontinued attending Church altogether, considering it racist. He passed
      away in 1931.</p>
      <p>The pledge as we know it was changed three times since Mr. Bellamy
      first penned it.</p>
      <p>On June 14, 1923, at the First National Flag Conference held in
      Washington, D.C., the 'leadership of the American Legion and the Daughters
      of the American Revolution changed the Pledge's words. The words &quot;the
      flag of the United States&quot; were substituted for &quot;my
      flag.&quot;on the grounds that some foreign-born children and adults when
      giving the Pledge might have in mind the flag of their native land.In
      1923,</p>
      <p>In 1924, &quot;of America&quot; was added.</p>
      <p>The Pledge of Allegiance continued to be recited daily by children in
      schools across America, and gained heightened popularity among adults
      during the patriotic fervor created by World War II. It still was an
      &quot;unofficial&quot; pledge until June 22, 1942 when the United States
      Congress included the Pledge to the Flag in the United States Flag Code
      (Title 36). In 1945 the Pledge to the Flag received its official title as:
      The Pledge of Allegiance</p>
      <p>The last change in the Pledge of Allegiance occurred on June 14 (Flag
      Day), 1954 when President Dwight D. Eisenhower approved adding the words
      &quot;under God&quot;. As he authorized this change he said: &quot;In this
      way we are reaffirming the transcendence of religious faith in America's
      heritage and future; in this way we shall constantly strengthen those
      spiritual weapons which forever will be our country's most powerful
      resource in peace and war.&quot;</p>
