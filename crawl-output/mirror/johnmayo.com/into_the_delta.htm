<p>If it can be grown in soil, the crop will be grown in the Mekong Delta of
Vietnam.&nbsp; Starting south of Ho Chi Minh City, the Mekong Delta is a vast
network of wide, slow flowing rivers all pouring into or anchored by the Mekong
River.&nbsp; Running through China, Myanmar (Burma), Laos, Thailand, and
Cambodia, the Mekong spreads out like fingers in Vietnam.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The network provides water for a variety of crops, the largest of which is
rice.&nbsp; But grown here are tomatoes, mangroves, lettuce, cocoanuts, fruits
of every exotic description, cattle, and on, and on, and on.</p>
<p>Forty or more years ago when I left Saigon, I would have immediately been in
the &quot;boonies&quot;.&nbsp; A two lane road took you past rice paddies that
went on forever, elephant ear jungles where at any marker someone could ambush
you in a heartbeat.&nbsp; Unpopulated except for the towns or hamlets along the
way, you were in the countryside.</p>
<p>Today for miles upon miles the four lane road separated into two lanes each
way by a highway type construction concrete barrier, the roadside is packed with
wall to wall shops.&nbsp; On this page is a small example of those shops.&nbsp;
The other chapters Can Tho City and the Can Tho River Market are paradise&nbsp;
in the middle of nowhere and an amazing river market that has existed for 100's
of years.</p>
<p>At one time you crossed the various rivers by ferry, today a very modern,
very beautiful toll bridge has been built by an Australian firm, others are
under construction, but the ferry is still used in many places.&nbsp; If I were
a tourist alone on this trip, traveling in the Delta would be worth the price of
admission.</p>
<p>Visit <a href="can_tho_city.htm">Can Tho City</a> and enjoy a trip up the
river to the 100's year old<a href="can_tho_river_market.htm"> River Market</a>.&nbsp;
Bring a cool one or two--it's hot</p>
<p>Here are some pictures of along the way to Can Tho.</p>
<table border="1" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%" valign="top"><img border="0" src="creek.JPG" width="320" height="240"> If there's no
      river, there is always a creek.&nbsp; Little boats are everywhere here as
      a primary means of transportation of everything from produce to
      computers.&nbsp; I would not do my clothes in these creeks, either if you
      get my drift.&nbsp; The government at all levels tries its best to be
      environmentally clean, but centuries old habits are hard to break.
      <p><img border="0" src="drying_incense.JPG" width="320" height="240"> A lady outside her home/shop
      dries incense.</p>
      <p><img border="0" src="incense_drying.jpg" width="325" height="246"> The
      leaves to the right are tea leaves.&nbsp; We were told that these would
      become the ingredient for incense.</p>
      <p><img border="0" src="shops.JPG" width="320" height="240"> The next series of pictures are
      shops.&nbsp; Thee top one is the line starting to form for the ferry still
      a couple miles away.&nbsp; This one is that far away because of the one of
      the very, very few (2) accidents we saw.&nbsp; Small wonder there are not
      more.&nbsp; The next few pictures give you an idea of just how cluttered
      the roadside is for 150 miles and why it took five hours to go 150
      miles.&nbsp; The return trip on an early Sunday morning took considerably
      less time.</p>
      <p><img border="0" src="store.JPG" width="320" height="240"></p>
      <p><img border="0" src="use.JPG" width="320" height="240"></p>
      <p><img border="0" src="shop_construction.JPG" width="320" height="240"> Here, I wanted to get a
      shot of the brick work.&nbsp; They use far different brick than we and the
      brick work would leave a lot to be desired by our brick layers.&nbsp; No
      matter, though.&nbsp; None of it will be exposed.&nbsp; It's all covered
      by stucco.</p>
      <p><img border="0" src="narrow_roads.JPG" width="320" height="240"> Get off the main road and you
      see much narrower what we would call farm to market roads and the roadside
      as you can see is not cluttered.</p>
      <p><img border="0" src="working_in_rice_paddy.JPG" width="320" height="240"> Planting rice by
      hand.&nbsp; Forty years ago this work would have been done by older and
      younger women.&nbsp; But, the younger people, like here, no longer like,
      want, or do this type of labor.&nbsp; Now a mix of old men and women do
      the work.&nbsp; EVERYONE works for their keep.&nbsp; In the Delta, the
      younger people opt to work in the factories.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><img border="0" src="drying_rice_2.JPG" width="320" height="240"> Rice drying on a main road.</p>
      <p><img border="0" src="ferry_traffic.jpg" width="320" height="243"> The
      line for the ferry begins to thicken.&nbsp; We are about one mile from the
      ferry and this is ferry waiting traffic.&nbsp; Once in a town, the traffic
      will snake through the area.</p>
      <p><img border="0" src="ferry_traffic_2.jpg" width="324" height="245"></p>
      <p><img border="0" src="ferries.jpg" width="324" height="246"> At least
      seven ferries were operating the day we were here.&nbsp; There's little
      waiting, loading is very organized, no one complains (at least not out
      loud).&nbsp; Some ferries just take the motor bikes.&nbsp; There are two
      landings about 50 yards apart on each side of the river.&nbsp; I got out
      of our van to stretch and look for the facilities (waiting in line does
      take its toll).&nbsp; I passed some guys using the river.&nbsp; They just
      grinned at me.&nbsp; I couldn't find any facilities, went back to where
      the guys were standing in the back, determined windage, and joined
      in.&nbsp; When you gotta, you gotta.</p>
