<p>Long Binh was the home of the largest supply and administrative post in the
world, probably.&nbsp; If it came to Vietnam, chances are it either arrived here
or was certainly processed here.&nbsp; I know of many folks at the Capital who
were stationed here.&nbsp; John Allison with the Banking and Consumer Finance
Agency, Mac Gordon, the House of Representative's Public Information Director
among them.</p>
<p>Long Binh is now a small Vietnamese army installation and a large Industrial
Park, including a High Tech Park.</p>
<p>Bear Cat, was one of our two primary spots to locate.&nbsp; Bear Cat was the
home of the 9th Infantry Division and its many supporting elements.&nbsp; Rep.
Mac Huddleston flew helicopters out of here for a while.&nbsp; This was my
initial and final home. More than 10,000 soldiers were located here at one time.</p>
<p>Today, Bear Cat is an Army Officer's School for the Vietnamese Army, a
mangrove plantation, and a rubber plantation.&nbsp; Besides the base itself,
about 2 miles long and a mile wide, we cleared an area out from the perimeter of
about 1,000 meters to give us a clear line of sight and fire.</p>

    <td width="50%" valign="top">Well, by the first picture, you know you are at Long Binh.&nbsp;
      The remaining pictures are original buildings to the base from more than
      40 years ago.
      <p>Thousands upon thousands of military people of all types and Vietnamese
      laborers, office workers, professional worked here.</p>
      <p>I have an old picture taken from some 15 miles away, but one night, VC
      sappers snuck into the Ammunition Supply Point and blew most of it
      up.&nbsp; The explosions and fires lasted for days. No one was hurt as it
      was spread out, but most of the multi square mile base was evacuated to
      prevent injury.</p>
      <p>I was pay officer for our battalion for one month and actually drew my
      money from John Allison's unit.</p>
      <p>The picture with the Vietnamese flag is actually a plant for a foreign corporation.&nbsp; You can probably name many US top 500 and find many
      here.</p>
      <p>Nike has 38 plants in Vietnam...and you thought they were made in
      Oregon or wherever.&nbsp; The Vietnamese make very low wages, Nike sells
      very expensive sneakers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

    <td width="50%" valign="top">We landed by ship in Vietnam in October of 1968.&nbsp; Got
      on a plane and flew onto a dirt strip in the middle of a jungle.&nbsp;
      This was a Special Forces outpost northeast of Saigon.&nbsp; Our job was
      to expand this small encampment into a base large enough for 10,000
      soldiers.
      <p>We further widened the perimeter out some 1,000 meters for fields of
      fire.&nbsp; The top picture is what we determined to be what was left of
      one side of the perimeter berm.&nbsp; It would have been two or three feet
      higher, high enough to prevent direct rifle fire from coming into the
      base.&nbsp; We felt this was the berm because there were some fairly old
      trees growing on it.</p>
      <p>Behind the berm the trees you see are part of a mangrove plantation.</p>
      <p>The next picture are the tents we lived in.</p>
      <p>An Army Officer training facility is all that is left of our
      base.&nbsp; We had to take this picture from the van.</p>
      <p>The next is part of a huge rubber plantation.&nbsp; One side of Bear
      Cat was in fact a rubber plantation and that has been expanded to take in
      the area we had cleared out 42 years ago.&nbsp; That's me next to a rubber
      tree.</p>
      <p>Shops line the road into the camp.&nbsp; I could print 100's of these
      kinds of pictures.&nbsp; On our trip into the delta, shops lined the road
      just like this for nearly 100 miles.&nbsp; I wish I were exaggerating, but
      I am not.</p>
      <p>Note how narrow they are.&nbsp; The two story shop/apartment would sell
      for $1 million USD in Saigon.&nbsp; There are 10's of thousands of such
      shops in Saigon and environs.&nbsp; How they can make money with so many
      competing was beyond me.</p>
      <p>I left Bear Cat to move into the Delta in late January of 1967 to go to
      Tan An and then Tan Tru, home for my platoon supporting the 2nd/60th Inf,
      9th Inf Division.</td>
